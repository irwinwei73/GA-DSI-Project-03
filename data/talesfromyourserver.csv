Around 4 days ago we got a new system made by the owner because he thinks someone is stealing from him. We don’t have a computer system so all orders are made by hand. We have the sushi sheet paper that I’m sure most people are familiarized with, where you write the amount of a roll you want. We used to throw those to the sushi bar and then write a separate paper for the kitchen. 

Well now, we had to rewrite everything, so if we get the sushi sheet we would have to write everything on a different paper (name and quantity) so that the sushi chefs could keep the paper. 

I hope this is not too confusing lol.

Also because they were gonna keep the paper now there was no way for servers to know where food would go unless it was your own. This means that other servers cannot help out other servers by taking their food. The sushi chefs also said they weren’t gonna be saying who the food would go toad everyone should be doing their job (lol ok).

So today is Thursday and we have a live band. It’s usually super busy. This one server was late 2 hours already so we were short of people. One party of 20 come in, I’m assigned to it. I take the drinks and then order them. Then ANOTHER TABLE OF 20 come in 15 min after and it was supposed to be assigned to the server that wasn’t there, so somehow I had to take it. It took forever, specially because the first table was ready to order. I had to somehow manage to give everyone their drinks and take everyone’s orders. 

It would of been easier if the tables got one check for each (but that could only be a dream) there are about 7-13 tickets on each table. So I had 16 or so tickets (sushi sheets) that I HAD TO REWRITE. That took forever, and not only that, appetizers for one table had already started to come out. Also it was super confusing too, I had to look at the papers about three times to make sure I made the orders right. I still ended up forgetting someone’s meal lol so yeah.

Taking all that food by myself and giving out refills was a nightmare. Taking 40 people at the same time alone is so freaking draining. 

Either way, Saturday is my last day lmao. Gotta say bye to serving finally.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So just some context for this shit show.&lt;/p&gt;

We observed the fiasco next to us for an hour while we dined — our server exceeded our expectations while we watched him handle the manipulative jerks next to us with such grace — they occupied so much of his time. They began their fiasco with complaining about *ice cubes*, it was a man and a woman dining together and the man had asked for his drink with no ice, and he insinuated that she wouldn’t want ice either. When the server brought their drinks, the woman made a huge fuss because she wanted ice and was *so thirsty,* but absolutely incapable of drinking without ice; our server remedied this situation immediately and maintained a pleasant attitude. They continued to complain about everything all night, and their reasons were by far the most absurd I’ve ever heard. “I just do not like the presentation of this meal, it’s completely unacceptable food placement.” They were given multiple replacement meals through out their dining experience, and even dessert. They ate at least half of each meal before insisting on a new one. The manager was called over more than once. It was absolutely mind-blowing, not only because they were clearly eating the food, but because their complaints were so lame. They put zero effort into their shenanigans, it was honestly pathetic. 

After the shameless duo left, the cops showed up and went back to the kitchen. My bf and I asked our server if everything was okay when he came to bring us our check and he just broke down and let it all out. He really needed to vent. He told us that the cops arrived because there was another server there who was stealing people’s tables (and abandoning his own?!) and taking everyone’s tips. He was fired and then he started getting violent and threatening to do outrageous things to staff and customers. Management had no choice but to call the police. Our server told us he had stolen all of his tips that night and on previous occasions, and to make matters worse, the absolute train wreck couple he served next to us left him no tip at all despite their *meals* being comped &amp; despite that they forced him to bend over backwards to accommodate their absolutely ridiculous demands. Even if their complaints had been legitimate, their biggest alleged disappointment had to do with the food, not the service. The server did his job and they literally treated him like a slave. Their entitlement was absolutely astonishing. He told us he gets customers like that on a regular basis — customers who play “the game” and know full and well what they’re doing — they plan this charade before even arriving and restaurant hop repeating similar stunts, never having the intention on paying a dime. It was stressful just sitting next to those people, I can’t imagine having to appease people like that on a regular basis. We ended up giving him a 100% cash tip. Poor guy. 

My utmost respect goes out to all servers. My BFF is a GM of a restaurant and he worked his way up over the years. He has done literally every job in the restaurant.

It only further reassured me that even if a server is “off their game,” I am doing the right thing by tipping well for okay service, and tipping above average for good service. Maybe years of hearing restaurant stories has helped mold my mindset and taught me to always be fair, and to be generous when deserved, but seeing it myself made me want to be even more generous when I have the means.

My coworkers are all so nice and honestly it’s probably been one of my better jobs in customer service solely because of them. Except the select few, of course. 

Onto tonight, it’s not extremely busy but definitely far past where it normally is. The bar is relatively packed, but we have 2 bartenders on and they are KILLING IT. Or so we had all thought. Turns out that bartender A was picking up all of bartender B’s slack and basically doing everything, between making drinks and handling take outs and food orders for in house. It’s really too much for one person to handle, but Bartender B just wasn’t doing her part. We did not find this out until later, after Bartender A had left since her shift ended around 7. 

Now there only remains Bartender B, and she is taking way too long for everything. By this point she is not as busy as before, maybe 10 people, and took 15 minutes to pour a shot. Not a mixed drink or a draft, a shot which would take 10 seconds. I ended up helping her take take out orders and stock her bar when she got too busy.

I’ve got several stories from being a waitress back in my teenage days but I’ll tell you my favorite one. 

I got my first job when I was 16 at a local diner. I had been there several months when this incident occurred so I had already somewhat ‘mastered’ the art of carrying multiple things at a time. For a little background, this diner had specials that included a bottled drink (to save money on refills). The fridge that held all our bottle drinks was next to a section of 5 tables.

So it was a Sunday afternoon. The lunch crowd had poured in and we were very busy. A table I was serving ordered 4 specials, so 4 bottled drinks. I grab some cups to fill with ice and put them on a tray. I headed to the fridge and started getting the bottled drinks out and placed them on the tray as well.  As I began to put the 4th bottle, which was a Diet Coke, on the tray it slips out of my hand and lands standing up on the floor. Half a split second later, the lid exploded and Diet Coke shoots straight up into the air, hitting the ceiling and showering the section of 5 tables. 

I was mortified and drenched, old ladies were frantically patting their church dresses with napkins, coke was still dripping from the ceiling, people’s meals were ruined.. My boss (who didn’t like me anyways) looked at me with pure rage and yelled at me to clean it up. I was in tears and shaking from being so upset. Luckily most of the victims were nice about it and told me not to worry. One guy even joked that he didn’t remember hearing coke showers in today’s forecast.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glad I stumbled on this sub.

&lt;p&gt;So it was a Sunday afternoon. The lunch crowd had poured in and we were very busy. A table I was serving ordered 4 specials, so 4 bottled drinks. I grab some cups to fill with ice and put them on a tray. I headed to the fridge and started getting the bottled drinks out and placed them on the tray as well.  As I began to put the 4th bottle, which was a Diet Coke, on the tray it slips out of my hand and lands standing up on the floor. Half a split second later, the lid exploded and Diet Coke shoots straight up into the air, hitting the ceiling and showering the section of 5 tables. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was mortified and drenched, old ladies were frantically patting their church dresses with napkins, coke was still dripping from the ceiling, people’s meals were ruined.. My boss (who didn’t like me anyways) looked at me with pure rage and yelled at me to clean it up. I was in tears and shaking from being so upset. Luckily most of the victims were nice about it and told me not to worry. One guy even joked that he didn’t remember hearing coke showers in today’s forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

I've posted on here before about how management can't make a correct schedule if they had a gun to their head and how our scores as a corporate restaurant (those ziosk surveys) have went downhill.

I walked into work today to see this huge note about how we should be pre-bussing, refilling drinks, etc., all this basic fucking shit we all know to do.

Meanwhile, there's no expo. We have a new server and a trainee and two closers. Togo is fucked. We have no flat-top cook so of course the one manager is on the line the whole time.

Manager was just back from vacation. I looked at the note at the end of the day, turned to him, and said, ""Do you think not pre-bussing was our issue today?""

He said he'd talk to the other managers. I'm not holding my breath.

God damnit, if the $$$ wasn't good I'd be out of this place in a heartbeat. 

Oh, also, my scores went down so they decided to cut my hours in half and only schedule me closing and cocktail shifts on the weekend... Thanks? You mean our shittiest, busiest days? Why don't you just fire me now??? 

Fuck this place. I was having a good time until all y'all decided to drop the ball in a major way... scheduling manager literally told me she had to start going to therapy because of this place.

I told her corporate should cover it because of the bullshit

If you can't be bothered to look your server in the eye, you will get bad service. Studies with no scientific merit except for my years of experience state that quality of service drops 22% if you don't look a human in the eye.

If you interrupt your server's greeting with your drink order, the same studies prove you lose an additional 24% of service. You are doing ""great"", or ""not bad"" or ""my blind brother's service dog passed away today at 14, so I could be better. God we loved Barkly"". You are not doing or feeling ""sweet tea extra ice"".

If you ask for something, then ask for it again before they walk away from the table, you might as well pack it up and go home. Don't ask a server for bread, give them your drink orders, ask again if the restaurant has bread, order an app, and then remind your server again that you might like some bread as they walk away. I promise you that even if a Wonderbread truck flipped over in the parking lot they will be out of bread for the next ten minutes. 

Speaking of bread, DON'T ASK FOR BREAD. At least not immediately. We get it, Linda, you're hungry and come from a poor island nation where you've only eaten fruit and grubs, and the thought of that sweet, free gluten is more than you can stand. But I promise you, your server wants nothing more than to bring you bread as soon as possible so you'll be quiet. 

Lastly, for now anyway, don't bookend your visit to the restaurant with the ""We always get bad service, but we're gonna try again"" line. It sets the expectation for the whole experience. Servers know, 90% of the time, what that means. Positivity goes a long way.

My boss gets upset due to them just releasing the schedule five minutes prior to me asking to not put me on for that weekend.  A few minutes before this they just had asked me to come in again to cover for someone else. My boss says I&amp;#39;m being irresponsible and I need to act more like an adult. I didn&amp;#39;t find out about this trip till last night, I&amp;#39;m eighteen and have been working at this restuarant since I was fifthteen years old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am not one of the people who call out often. I don&amp;#39;t get sick very much and my homelife is troubling but I separate the two from my work life. I take shifts when I can and sometimes I&amp;#39;m one of those suckers to cancel what I have to do to help out. So my boss lecturing on me being the irresponsible one when I have coworkers who seem to be &amp;quot;sick&amp;quot; every week is beyond fustrating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am wondering from the actual restaurant owners/managers, coworkers who can fit in my shoes, and even those who do or have in the past been one of those to call out a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How have you been treated for leaving work often or what real reasons do you have to calling out? What goes down at a restaurant if one of your workers can&amp;#39;t come in and no one can cover? How do you handle the situation with an employee who doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be reliable? And for those in my shoes, how do you go on with dealing with constantly being called on as a backup and when it&amp;#39;s time for you finally needing to call out.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been in the restaurant/service industry since my very first job at 15 at a lovely place with just lovely golden arches. ;) I am on mobile and through reading all of your posts understand I should apologize for that! 

Anywho, I have a story from roughly 3 months ago that STILL bothers me to this day as my company and GM (who granted, has been fired since this incident, for other reasons) really never did or said anything about it. TL;DR at the bottom!! 

So, I work at a ""Craft Beer Bar"" up in Canada. Money is relatively good, coworkers are good and customers are also usuuually good. I should mention that the dress code for this bar is just ""all black"" like there's not really too many restrictions minus your whole outfit needs to be black in colour. Girls who are definitely more fit and stereotypically ""attractive"" than I am have definitely had worse experiences than this but this one really hit me where it hurt. SO.

This one particular day I was working a day shift, (since then I have switched to closing most often) it was a steady day, I always had at least 6 tables and being the only server/bartender on, I wasn't swamped but always had something that needed to be done. My GM at the time was generally lazy, would sit and mess around on his laptop for most of the day and complain to anyone if he had to run food or make any drinks. Anyways, I got up to about 11 tables during the happy hour rush before the next server started and was understandably falling a little behind! A new table comes in, a man and his wife(???) sit close to the bar so the GM offers to take drink orders for me, cool thanks dude! I appreciated the help. He (GM) comes up to me after taking this tables drinks over and says ""That guy's a mega douche"" ok cool whatever i've dealt with my fair share of guys like that in this industry, everyone has! 

I notice they're still perusing the menu and so I go to take a payment and run some food before asking the table in question how they're doing with the menu, no biggie, usual stuff. I went up maybe 5 minutes later and used my usual ""Hey guys! How are we doing with the menu so far? Do you need another minute or 2?"" and DEADASS this guy looks at me for the first time and just STOPS and STARES way too obviously and rudely (imo) at my chest. Yes, as a server we see a lot of people looking at the uh, ""goods"" whatever. Happens all the time and usually I pay no notice to it! Had this guy just stared I wouldn't have been as upset. But no, this man decides to say to me ""WOW! Hey uh, yeah we'll probably need a.... wow, sorry I am just SO DISTRACTED by your PERFECT TITS right now... like, WOW!!!"" Visibly uncomfortable, I say ""uhhh, ok I'll give you two some more time with the menus.."",walk away to do some things for my other tables and let my manager know that this guy was saying inappropriate things to me. He just said to handle it. Threw me off a little bit but i've had worse customers so I thought whatever. 

I come back another couple of minutes later, and ask the same thing of sorts, ""Have we decided on anything to munch on for today?"" and this guy AGAIN says ""OH WOW, it's you.. i'm just SO distracted by your amazing tits right now... Could you maybe just stand there for a minute?"" whilst his eyes are just LOCKED on my chest. I'm not even sure this guy saw my face the whole time he was in the building. Wife(?) said nothing. Obviously creeped out and honestly, offended I ask the opening server (who yes, was more modest than I am in her outfit choices but hello I can dress how I want, my outfit is not an invitation for you to be like this, ok thanks) if she could just make sure they got their food and take their payment when needed. 

As she watched over them, still under my number (so their bill would still be on my cashout) they were pleasant, the guy didn't say anything to her that was inappropriate whatsoever and the wife(?? we still don't know what their relationship was) literally did not say a single word the whole time they were there. 
As they were paying and leaving, the man happened to almost bump into me running food to another table and gave me a GROSS up and down look and said ""Thank you so much!"" with a creepy looking smile which honestly made me feel worse about it all. Ugh. 

So that's the end of the interactions I had with these two. I was grossed out and feeling like a whore in all honesty. I may be a server at a male-dominated-customer-base bar but I DO NOT THINK ITS RIGHT FOR YOU TO SAY THAT KIND OF THING TO ME!! I don't get paid enough to deal with that. At the end of my shift that day, my GM pulled me aside and said simply and matter-of-factly ""Thank you for handling that guy the way you did. I don't think any other server here would have been so professional about it."" AND IT MADE ME MAD. I TOLD HIM AFTER THIS CREEPS FIRST INTERACTION WITH ME THAT I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE SERVING HIM BUT HE DID NOTHING AND JUST STOOD BEHIND THE BAR. 

Come to find out later on that the lady this creep was with left a $20 under her plate. Not too sure if it was pity money? A sort of ""Sorry for my husband"" tip? Either way I was angry at the fact that she said nothing to him or I about the whole situation. 

I guess in sharing this with you guys i'm just looking to find people who have dealt with similar situations and how you and your managers handled it? When I told my mom about it she said my GM should have kicked him out and called the cops. I think the cops part may be a little far but I do think he should have done something more than thank me for my professionalism. Open to advice/stories. :)

TL;DR - Man + Lady come in, lady says nothing for the whole time they're there, man decides to tell me that my ""tits"" are perfect and does nothing but harass me about them the whole time I wait on them. GM does absolutely nothing but thanks me for being so ""professional"".","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all, I (21F) joined this group as soon as I got a Reddit account! I&amp;#39;ve been in the restaurant/service industry since my very first job at 15 at a lovely place with just lovely golden arches. ;) I am on mobile and through reading all of your posts understand I should apologize for that! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anywho, I have a story from roughly 3 months ago that STILL bothers me to this day as my company and GM (who granted, has been fired since this incident, for other reasons) really never did or said anything about it. TL;DR at the bottom!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I work at a &amp;quot;Craft Beer Bar&amp;quot; up in Canada. Money is relatively good, coworkers are good and customers are also usuuually good. I should mention that the dress code for this bar is just &amp;quot;all black&amp;quot; like there&amp;#39;s not really too many restrictions minus your whole outfit needs to be black in colour. Girls who are definitely more fit and stereotypically &amp;quot;attractive&amp;quot; than I am have definitely had worse experiences than this but this one really hit me where it hurt. SO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one particular day I was working a day shift, (since then I have switched to closing most often) it was a steady day, I always had at least 6 tables and being the only server/bartender on, I wasn&amp;#39;t swamped but always had something that needed to be done. My GM at the time was generally lazy, would sit and mess around on his laptop for most of the day and complain to anyone if he had to run food or make any drinks. Anyways, I got up to about 11 tables during the happy hour rush before the next server started and was understandably falling a little behind! A new table comes in, a man and his wife(???) sit close to the bar so the GM offers to take drink orders for me, cool thanks dude! I appreciated the help. He (GM) comes up to me after taking this tables drinks over and says &amp;quot;That guy&amp;#39;s a mega douche&amp;quot; ok cool whatever i&amp;#39;ve dealt with my fair share of guys like that in this industry, everyone has! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I notice they&amp;#39;re still perusing the menu and so I go to take a payment and run some food before asking the table in question how they&amp;#39;re doing with the menu, no biggie, usual stuff. I went up maybe 5 minutes later and used my usual &amp;quot;Hey guys! How are we doing with the menu so far? Do you need another minute or 2?&amp;quot; and DEADASS this guy looks at me for the first time and just STOPS and STARES way too obviously and rudely (imo) at my chest. Yes, as a server we see a lot of people looking at the uh, &amp;quot;goods&amp;quot; whatever. Happens all the time and usually I pay no notice to it! Had this guy just stared I wouldn&amp;#39;t have been as upset. But no, this man decides to say to me &amp;quot;WOW! Hey uh, yeah we&amp;#39;ll probably need a.... wow, sorry I am just SO DISTRACTED by your PERFECT TITS right now... like, WOW!!!&amp;quot; Visibly uncomfortable, I say &amp;quot;uhhh, ok I&amp;#39;ll give you two some more time with the menus..&amp;quot;,walk away to do some things for my other tables and let my manager know that this guy was saying inappropriate things to me. He just said to handle it. Threw me off a little bit but i&amp;#39;ve had worse customers so I thought whatever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come back another couple of minutes later, and ask the same thing of sorts, &amp;quot;Have we decided on anything to munch on for today?&amp;quot; and this guy AGAIN says &amp;quot;OH WOW, it&amp;#39;s you.. i&amp;#39;m just SO distracted by your amazing tits right now... Could you maybe just stand there for a minute?&amp;quot; whilst his eyes are just LOCKED on my chest. I&amp;#39;m not even sure this guy saw my face the whole time he was in the building. Wife(?) said nothing. Obviously creeped out and honestly, offended I ask the opening server (who yes, was more modest than I am in her outfit choices but hello I can dress how I want, my outfit is not an invitation for you to be like this, ok thanks) if she could just make sure they got their food and take their payment when needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she watched over them, still under my number (so their bill would still be on my cashout) they were pleasant, the guy didn&amp;#39;t say anything to her that was inappropriate whatsoever and the wife(?? we still don&amp;#39;t know what their relationship was) literally did not say a single word the whole time they were there. 
As they were paying and leaving, the man happened to almost bump into me running food to another table and gave me a GROSS up and down look and said &amp;quot;Thank you so much!&amp;quot; with a creepy looking smile which honestly made me feel worse about it all. Ugh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s the end of the interactions I had with these two. I was grossed out and feeling like a whore in all honesty. I may be a server at a male-dominated-customer-base bar but I DO NOT THINK ITS RIGHT FOR YOU TO SAY THAT KIND OF THING TO ME!! I don&amp;#39;t get paid enough to deal with that. At the end of my shift that day, my GM pulled me aside and said simply and matter-of-factly &amp;quot;Thank you for handling that guy the way you did.

I would hear countless tales of shitty tables and a few times I overheard talk about this one guy that happens to dine in late when we’re close to closing early on in the week. He had plenty of nicknames, not very great ones either (ted bundy to name one). For the longest time I thought it was bullshit, he wasn’t a psychopath or insane or a serial killer, perhaps just a lonely guy who just preferred to dine alone and had some odd eating habits. Why should I judge? A few months back I finally saw him for the first time, and I had caught him staring at me across the floor a few times, and him staring at my ass once but I’ve dealt with much more strange people in my life, so I brushed it off. Fast forward to late August or so. I happen to stop in at the grocery store right after I get off of my shift. I hate to use the restroom at work for some reason, so I stopped to use the restroom in the back of the store. Keep in mind that I had changed, so I wasn’t even dressed in uniform anymore. There’s this long weird hallway where the restrooms are, and there really isn’t much to it. I rush back and suddenly I see this guy just standing there with two half gallons of milk sitting in his basket and messing with the labels. I’m literally about to shit my pants and he blurts out “hey! You work at _____ _____ right?” “Uhhh yeah, why” “oh, I’ve just thought I’ve seen you there before”. I knew the guy looked familiar but I hadn’t had time the think straight until I poured out my bowels. Then it kinda just clicked. Naturally I was a bit frightened by the strange encounter so I stayed in the bathroom for quite a bit and waited about 10-15 minutes. When I left he was gone but the cart and two half gallons of milk were still there. I was probably overreacting but I noped the fuck out of there. 

Fast forward a few weeks. I’m one of the closing servers and this guy was just sat in the other closing servers section. The other server was quite busy so I took a quick drink order and I was immediately incredibly uncomfortable. Every time I walked by he stared me down, I avoided eye contact at all costs but it was very obvious he was staring. I’m trying to clean my tables and he starts asking me really personal questions. I’m trying to be as kind as possible while attempting to get out of the situation but it’s not really working. This guy even guessed the year I was born. He leaves, the other server and I walk out together just in case. 

A week later, same day, same time. He requested me. I had never served him at this point. My friends were there at my other open table and we were all talking and laughing and whatnot. The other closing server is the same from last week, and it was super slow so we were doing the usual check in every so often, and then coming back and chatting again. We were talking about the guy, and I had told my coworker about the run in I had with him at the store. I try and brush it off but we both were a bit creeped out. The guy pays, and no other guest is in the restaurant so we decided to check out the window to snoop and see what car he drives. All is fine, we clock out after a while, walk out together, blah blah blah. 
I needed to stop into the store for dinner that night, and I pull up into the parking lot and I notice a car pull in looking strikingly similar. I get a bit nervous but decide to run in quick anyhow. I only needed two small things so I would be in and out in no time. As I’m checking out I spot the guy leave the store. When I left the store I noticed the car was gone, so that was a sigh of relief. However when I was pulling out I saw the same car, in a parking lot for another store two lots over. Which had closed probably around 2 hours prior. The car turns on, and starts to follow me. They’re behind me for a good while but I sped through a yellow light and luckily he had got stuck at the red light so I quickly took a shortcut home and sped the whole way back. I was shaking the whole time and I had trouble sleeping that night. It still scares me when I’m working a closing shift on that particular day of the week I’m terrified that I will see him again but it has been about 3 weeks since that incident and usually he stops in every week.

I've put the tl;dr at the top.

**tl;dr:** financially stuck at a restaurant with a server that makes me uncomfortable AF because I'm a target of low and high intensity hostility interspersed with periods of being really pleasant, can't do anything about it because this server is basically 'beloved' by the owners and is BFF's with the FoH manager. Have been warned by others she can get me fired, have been threatened directly by her that she can have me removed from her shifts (which would put me out of a job cuz they're the only one's I can work), confirmed by the FoH manager (she was sitting right there and said nothing).

**Prologue**

Recently started working at a small restaurant. I don't really feel the need to get into the deets about the restaurant because tbh I have yet to work a single shift where the work itself was unmanageable and the guests are consistently awesome. My issue is my coworker. During the day shift there is one support staff, one server, and sometimes the FoH manager is hanging around the front to be extra support. It can get really busy, and the server is definitely extremely qualified to be doing her job, on a professional level.

Unfortunately, her personality, at least when it comes to me, leaves a lot to be desired. My first day there she said goodbye to everyone in the room except me. It was a small group, and it was obvious to everyone present, and someone mumbled 'awkward' after she had left. For weeks, she wouldn't look at me when I talked to her unless she was absolutely forced to by the way we were standing. Sometimes she'd flat out ignore something I'd say to her, which at first was attempts to break the ice (because it was fucking thick), then eventually just work-related requests. I'd say them pointblank range and she'd walk away like she never heard it.

This wasn't an issue though as we never spent more than an hour of our respective shifts on the clock at the same time. A few weeks back though, my hours were cut and I was moved to days to work with her. These shifts turned out to be fairly busy and after two weeks of working my ass off and really just not giving a fuck about trying to be friendly w/her, just professional, I impressed both her &amp; the FoH manager, got an extra shift, and the ice started to melt and we started getting along better. She went out of her way to talk to me, though I was a little hesitant to be receptive it was nice and surprising and I started to let my guard down.

**The Shitstorm**

The very next day, I am **fifteen** minutes late to work. When I got there, it wasn't busy, but it got obscenely busy pretty qucik. Before I even had any chances to make mistakes, her whole attitude was a complete 180 from the previous day. idk how to describe it outside of just 'salty AF'. She had a pissed off look on her face whenever she looked at me, told me to do something for her in a condescending manner like I should've known she needed it done, etc. The attitude shift was jarring and tbh I felt a little betrayed, like I'd been lulled into letting my guard down just so she could attack.

It threw me through a loop and I made a few mistakes on food items and starting a task I should've put off for later because it wasn't important (although I really just wanted to be far away from her). At one point I asked for the rag she had in her hand while she was three feet away from me to wipe something down between us, to which she looked away from me and walked back to set it down behind the bar. I looked at the table behind her who watched it unfold and they just gave me a 'what the fuck?' look. Ultra unprofessional, ultra butthurt.

While this is going on and I'm picking up food to run to a table, the head chef tells me to stop saying 'thank you' when I pick up food. my bad for being polite. An hour later I made a comment about the music they were playing &amp; got a 'not a good time for a conversation' in a rather nasty tone.

After two hours of this I started to get fucking pissed so I started mirroring her behavior back towards her. It just upset her further. By the end of the day the FoH Manager had had to 'correct me' three separate times and I was completely drained. I really wanted to just walk away but I really, really enjoy the job and like all of my coworkers except this particular one rubs the wrong way, consistently. I ended up taking 100% of the responsibility in an apology text to the FoH manager, because I need the job (and there are things I definitely could've done better, I was getting defensive by the end of the day after feeling attacked on all fronts). I definitely felt like I couldn't explain what was happening that shift to the FoH manager, both because my attitude had tanked by shift's end and for reasons I've detailed below.

**The Aftermath**

So our next shift rolls around and I apologize to the server face to face, with the manager sitting next to me. In all honesty, it was pretty painful for me; all I could manage is 'I'd like to apologize for being a dick friday' (I was, justifiable or not.) She responded with a tirade about how I was late, messy (i'll give her this but seriously if it's friday night busy and we have a 1/3rd of the FoH for it, things are gonna get messy), and my attitude fucked up her groove, essentially placing the blame of her entire shitty day squarely on my shoulders. She topped it off with ""I thought we were getting to a point where we were working well together, and I would like to go back to that. But we dont' have to. If I don't want to work with you, you won't be scheduled with me anymore"" (paraphrased).

It wasn't an 'in your face' tirade, it was pretty dispassionate, calm and collected. She genuinely believed it was 100% my fault. I was stunned, I didn't know what to say at all, so I said nothing. After an awkward silence she adds as an afterthought ""But I appreciate your apology though."". I can't remember if I said anything when I got up and walked away to start working.

**What the fuck is going on? Do something about it!**

You might be wondering ""Why didn't you tell your manager that your server was treating you like shit and it threw you off your game?""

Unfortunately, the other support staff and some servers basically warned me that this particular server is super ""IN"" with the owners and FoH Manager. and it's true, the FoH manager and this server party and drink together and hang out a lot. They're BFF's. Between these warnings, how good of friends they obviously are, and the FoH manager's text responses to my apology where she kept using 'we' (her and the server) instead of 'I', just solidifyied the feeling that this server really does have the power to have me fired.

This is a small restaurant. There is no HR, no corporate structure I can go to to seek help because a coworker is making me feel uncomfortable. I don't have the money to leave, I don't even really **want** to leave. I love working here. Every single coworker, every aspect about the work itself, even the chef that was bein a dick. Love it all. Except for her. I dread going to work now, because of her. I don't know what mood I'm going to get. When people are shitty towards me eventually I crack, it's a weakness. I don't know if she's going to get salty and take her stress out on me again. I don't know if she's going to have me removed from the schedule (effectively fired because I have nowhere else to go on it).

She's been pretty icy since. I don't really talk to her, because I literally have nothing to say even when I try to think of something. I blank out. It's obvious she doesn't really like or respect me, even if she is tolerating me and being polite (for now). I bust my ass, so frankly it's both insulting, and disappointing, because when we were getting along, she seemed really cool. In generally, the entire situation makes me incredibly uncomfortable. I feel like I'm stuck in a lowkey hostile work environment, that maybe could be described as 'tensions cooling' but who tf knows when they'll flare back up again.

**#endrant**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very, &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; long, and definitely qualifies as a rant, and I apologize for it&amp;#39;s length. I&amp;#39;ve put the tl;dr at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; financially stuck at a restaurant with a server that makes me uncomfortable AF because I&amp;#39;m a target of low and high intensity hostility interspersed with periods of being really pleasant, can&amp;#39;t do anything about it because this server is basically &amp;#39;beloved&amp;#39; by the owners and is BFF&amp;#39;s with the FoH manager. Have been warned by others she can get me fired, have been threatened directly by her that she can have me removed from her shifts (which would put me out of a job cuz they&amp;#39;re the only one&amp;#39;s I can work), confirmed by the FoH manager (she was sitting right there and said nothing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prologue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently started working at a small restaurant. I don&amp;#39;t really feel the need to get into the deets about the restaurant because tbh I have yet to work a single shift where the work itself was unmanageable and the guests are consistently awesome. My issue is my coworker. During the day shift there is one support staff, one server, and sometimes the FoH manager is hanging around the front to be extra support. It can get really busy, and the server is definitely extremely qualified to be doing her job, on a professional level.&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes she&amp;#39;d flat out ignore something I&amp;#39;d say to her, which at first was attempts to break the ice (because it was fucking thick), then eventually just work-related requests.

He runs the BOH, I run the FOH. We both still fill in where needed on busy nights, like tonight.

I was busy in the FOH, when one of my staff came and told me that some lady and my business partner had an issue in the hall (near the bathrooms, but also near the door to the walk-in and dry storage). 

I immediately went to my business partner and asked what happened. He told me that some lady was standing (on her phone) on the wrong side of the “employees only” door, blocking the walk-in and he told her that it was an employee only area and asked her to step outside of the area. She responded with “Well, aren’t you fucking rude” and he responded with “I’m not trying to be, but this is a restricted area, and I need you please leave”. She then responded with “I’m not fucking doing anything and you don’t have to be an asshole”. 

Finally, she stepped outside of the area and he continued doing what he was doing. FYI for all of you people that DO NOT UNDERSTAND how things work in a restaurant, the entire staff was aware of this incident before this lady finished peeing, so beware when you cause a scene, we ALL KNOW and in record time. 

I asked who she was and as she was exiting the bathroom and working her way to the hostess stand, he pointed her out. I decided I needed to  seat her and confront her about her blatant disrespect of “the cook”. 

I went up and she said “two”, I said “Okay. Hey, did you happen to have an issue with one of my cooks?” Her jaw dropped and she just said “SERIOUSLY???” I said yes and proceeded to explain his version of the story and “SHE DENIED EVERYTHING!” 

She claimed “THAT COOK  was rude to me. I wasn’t even in that area. He was looking for a fight”. Blah, blah, blah. I just said “Okay, well that COOK is actually the OWNER and I can promise you he wouldn’t be rude to a customer for absolutely no reason”. She then proceeds to say, “Well then why is he sending a HOSTESS to talk to me. He should apologize to me himself”. I pause and say “Well, Mam, I’m the other owner and I’m trying to get the entire story”. She then says “You’re all attacking me. I’m taking my business elsewhere”. 

I could just feel her “I’ve been busted” guilt. 

Can you believe this lady? She clearly has ZERO respect for people in these positions. She CLEARLY would treat anyone she could get away with like that and it just so happened to backfire on her, double time! 

People like this piss me off. I do everything I can to blend into my restaurant, and so does my partner. We want to earn respect and give respect. I cannot imagine what this would’ve been had this been a few of our staff members. I would’ve completely lost it. She’s lucky....

Also, she denied cursing “because she’s a mother”. OKAY!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So long story short, my business partner and I have owned a restaurant together for 3 years. He runs the BOH, I run the FOH. We both still fill in where needed on busy nights, like tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was busy in the FOH, when one of my staff came and told me that some lady and my business partner had an issue in the hall (near the bathrooms, but also near the door to the walk-in and dry storage). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately went to my business partner and asked what happened. He told me that some lady was standing (on her phone) on the wrong side of the “employees only” door, blocking the walk-in and he told her that it was an employee only area and asked her to step outside of the area. She responded with “Well, aren’t you fucking rude” and he responded with “I’m not trying to be, but this is a restricted area, and I need you please leave”. She then responded with “I’m not fucking doing anything and you don’t have to be an asshole”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, she stepped outside of the area and he continued doing what he was doing. FYI for all of you people that DO NOT UNDERSTAND how things work in a restaurant, the entire staff was aware of this incident before this lady finished peeing, so beware when you cause a scene, we ALL KNOW and in record time. &lt;/p&gt;

You were angry I couldn't give you my undivided attention. I'm sorry it was only just me serving a full house small cafe I've got other people to worry about too. Thank goodness my coworker came and helped me out. 

Apparently something was wrong with your food. Maybe wasn't cooked enough for you? Yet when I asked multiple times how everything was, I was told it was great. If I had been told maybe I could have ordered you something else or even comped it!

Instead you went to good old Yelp to complain how everything was horrible and how your friend had to pay for this awful meal from the awful server. According to both of them they had a good time and everything was great though 🙃

Uhhhh no? What dude, you think we have a huge database in the back with everybodys personal information and every gift card we have given since opening?

So on a Sunday night I was hosting, and I just got done bagging a togo order and and about 10 minutes after bagging it the driver came and picked it up, normal hosting stuff goes. we're busier than usual, whatever, when our phone rings.

Me: Sure thing, I'll see if I can go get him  (The manager was on the line helping the cook)

5 minutes later she calls back  


Me: Thank you for calling (blah blah blah)  


Crazy Lady: Get me your manager

Me: He's busy on the line but I'll see if I can get him, I'll have to put you on hold

like 2 minutes pass

Me: Ma'am, the manager is busy and can not get to the phone right now, can I take a message?

CL: No, my Uber driver forgot my toast and he said he'll take care of it

\*record scratch\*

If there is something missing from an uber order, they go through uber to get it refunded, the manager messed up on that issue.  


Me: Ma;am, like I said, the manager is very busy on the cook line, would you like to leave your name and call back number so the manager can call you back when its not busy?   


CL: What is your name again?

Me: GeneralSalty

CL: I'm going to call back and im going to speak to your manager about you, you have been very innapropriate, and how she was implying my incompetency 

Me: Yes ma'am \*hangs up\*

I seat the tables that have been waiting for 5 minutes to be sat and I go into the kitchen to tell them what happened, and the second I tell them, the phone rings, and one of my co workers answers it instead, and deals with the demon again, this time, she did what I should've done and just hung up when she started insulting the restaurant and her, she also asked for her name too.  


About 30 minutes later she calls back, its died down a little bit and the manager answers the phone, after she accuses me and my co worker of RACIALLY PROFILING HER OVER THE PHONE, he just puts the phone down, does hang up, just puts it down and lets her keep talking. She talked for a good 10-15 minutes before she realized no one was responding to her, she threatened to come up here and talk to the manager but that never happened

This is my first post so hopefully i am doing this right. 

I got hired recently at a busy resturant. It was fine when i had a shadow for the first few days, then I was by myself. I had a pretty horrible first shift. I realized it takes allot of multi-tasking to be a server and maybe I am not cut out for it. 

I was constantly anxious about work before the shifts by myself and I worried I couldn't do it. Last shift I had, everyone needed to order and get drinks at all the same time so that overwhelmed me. I also do not like carrying allot of drinks at once since i am clumsy (same with food). The idea of any party over 6 scares me. My stupid anxiety always ruins everything good for myself. 

I am worried that i made a mistake by quitting. I figured being happy is worth more than money. I really feel i messed up big time and should have given it more time. Did i make the right decision? I went back to my old job which i make about $20 an hour. Yes the money is less but I know this job very well and it doesn't make me anxious even though it is a very busy place. The only difference between my old job and serving  is one of them is not table service (you have to order at the counter and we bring it out)  and serving is table service.

I hope I didn't make a huge mistake. Why was i cut out for My old job but not for the new serving one? I could have made so much money and i should have given it a chance. Stupid anxiety....

I work at a small cafe and bookstore. The staff is mostly volunteers. I am mostly a cashier.

I was at the cashier when a older man came in. I greeted him and he came to the till to order a coffee to go.

I was placing his order when I noticed he was starring at my chest. Mind you, this man could easily be old enough to be my grandfather. I turned to the coffee dispenser feeling uncomfortable but don't say anything.

Suddenly the man says ""Don't you think you are overdressed?"" I look at him and said politely ""No, Sir. We have a strict dress code here"" even though it wasn't true. You could wear whatever you wanted as long as it was appropriate and would not cause you to fall or get caught on something because it is a cafe.

The man huffed and told me ""That shouldn't matter. I'm the customer and you should dress to please me!""

I was horrified! I didn't know what to say. My manager wasn't on the floor so I couldn't go get her. I handed him his coffee and told him to have a good day even though I was shaking in rage.

He took his cup and told me ""Next time I come, I expect you to be showing more skin"" then he left.

I'M SO MAD!! IM NOT REQUIRED TO DRESS TO PLEASE ANY CUSTOMER!! I told my manager and she told him to next time he comes in and says something like that to come get her. She was also super pissed at this man. But because he didn't actually touch me or hurt me I feel as if there is nothing I can do.

My food came out smelling particularly bad ie super bad fishy smell.  I spent years in japan so I know what is good and what isn’t.  I can even tell when fish has gone bad and this was bad.  I didn’t eat a bite and asked the sever to please take it back.   They told me bc they make their food in a unique way they do not do refunds and I agreed and paid and even tipped on the bad food.   

This time they started advertising a buffet but when I went in the buffet was twice as much as advertised and apparently not really a buffet.  It’s a made to order menu.  I was starving and had four plates.   I had not eaten since the day before.   However I needed to use the bathroom and was eating alone.   They took my entire plate, glass, silverware everything even though i had let the waitress know I was going to the bathroom for two mins and would be right back.  

Well, I come back and have to ask for a new water, which they billed me for the water, a new plate, which apparently bc I didn’t finish the plate I was eating they bill you an extra 50 cents per roll that I wanted to finish on an all you can eat me umm I and then billed me extra for the new roll which was new but had that same exact horrible smell of burnt shrimp the first time I went in on an all you can eat buffett.   

I am extremely confused about charging extra for an all you can eat buffet bc I immediately handed the burnt shrimp to the waitress and said I’m sorry but this is burnt.   I then hear an obviously practiced line about how their food is unique and just bc every other restaurant makes a roll the same way theirs is different.   I recognize that this was the same waitress from my first experience and instead of tipping for the first time in my life, I decided to not tip bc she had decided to charge me for the extra water and first plate that they removed while I was in the bathroom.  I have never stiffed a waitress before in my life.

I felt smug for an hour.  However karma has gotten me.  As I was working on replacing a shower handle for my tenants.  I broke a vital plastic bit that has water pouring into my home.   I rushed outside to turn off the water and now have a 600 dollar plumbing bill bc of my karma for not tipping a waitress on doing her job, but I still disagree for charging for water and advertising for an all you can eat buffet but not allowing customers to get a single roll but make an entire roll them charge them for not wanting to eat 8 rolls of bad suishi when if it was a real buffet just having one or two of each is what I wanted and would be less wasteful.

Wing day turns our calm little restaurent into a Line Up Out The Door, Litterally No Spare Chairs, Everyone Is Quadruple Sat kinda place. We have no bartender. We have no host. No sections, bussers or runners. We have 3 fryers and 1 small oven.  It's a f*cking nightmare and food takes over an hour. People don't understand that if they tip %20 after the discount, it's really %10. And they don't... they tip %0-10 which is fine.

More detail could be given but I just needed you to picture the kind of mess and total depression the servers feel at the end of the night when we then get to sweep and mop it all for 2 hours past close. 

On to the story. Typical table came in an hour before close. We're calming down now and mostly trying to just bus everything. They tried to order things that weren't on the menu.  Waved at multiple servers that weren't theirs. Complained the fries were 'refried, and I'm a cook so I know' (they weren't). Contested the bill afterwards, and stiffed the server. Typical wing night table. 

As I bus nearby I see them get up and leave their phone right in the middle of the booth. I stand there saying nothing as they walk all the way across the restaurant and get into their car.  Now I have run forgotten takeout across that parking lot for a %10 percent tip before, but they didn't pay for that kind of service tonight in my opinion. We take the phone behind the bar and wait for their return. 

An hour goes by and nothing. All customers have left. The doors are locked, signs off. Just cleaning and cuttlery left. I get a phone call 45 minutes past close. Keep in mind we close late so this wasn't some casual 9:45 call.

Them ""Hey did you guys find a phone there? In the booth? Looked like ____""

Me ""Why yes we did!""

I’ve always looked way younger than i am. I’m sure lots of you can relate. I started serving when I was 18 and the comments I got then and now are the same. Think like “are you even old enough to carry my beer over?” “Sweetie have you ever even tried the beer?”  

Flash back to when I was 19. Been serving for a year and drinking as heavily as any college student. Where I worked was also very chill and I would get free beer from my bartender friends. Plus we were known for having a stupid amount of beer on tap, so I liked to try them so I could talk about them. And I’m not a moron. I know what types of beer exist and how to define them. 

This lady comes in and the first words out of her mouth are “I want a beer but nothing dark”. Great. Easy peasy. 

I start listing off my favorite and the most popular IPA’s, wheats, Belgians etc. 

She goes “No. I want this whateveritwas stout”. 

I go “ma’am that’s going to be a dark beer are you sure?”

“Honey you’re not old enough to know what this stuff is. I think I know what I’m doing. Just bring me that beer.”

Okay. 

I bring it back over and she goes “this isn’t what I ordered!”

I stared at her. Honestly a bit perplexed. “Yes it is. It’s that whatever stout”. 

“No honey. Stouts aren’t dark.”

“I mean this is the beer... do you want to order something else?”

“No you really don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m just going to go to the bar. “

She did. And then came back with some lite beer and didn’t say anything else to me besides when she ordered her food. 

TLDR: lady thinks I’m dumb and young ordered a stout despite hating dark beer, and eventually settles on a lite beer even though I tried to tell her what she was in for.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of people I served over the weekend reminded me of this story from a year or so ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Honey you’re not old enough to know what this stuff is. I think I know what I’m doing. Just bring me that beer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bring it back over and she goes “this isn’t what I ordered!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared at her. Honestly a bit perplexed. “Yes it is. It’s that whatever stout”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No honey. Stouts aren’t dark.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean this is the beer... do you want to order something else?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No you really don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m just going to go to the bar. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did. And then came back with some lite beer and didn’t say anything else to me besides when she ordered her food. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: lady thinks I’m dumb and young ordered a stout despite hating dark beer, and eventually settles on a lite beer even though I tried to tell her what she was in for.&lt;/p&gt;

Throughout my final year of my degree I worked at a bar part time on weekends to earn some extra money. This was a higher class bar that advertised towards business people and not the student population of the city. In this bar there were two separate bars: the main one downstairs with your standard on-tap beers and ciders, basic mixer drinks, and some top-shelf alcohol and the bar upstairs being the cocktail bar with basic mixers, cocktails, expensive champagne, and more top-shelf alcohol. I worked on the cocktail bar when this event took place. We shall call the lady in question K from now on and that'll become clear later. 

It was a busy weekend night at the other bar when B and her group came to my bar. Due to my bar being less busy I came over to see her straight away

Me: ""Good evening guys what can I get for you?""

K: ""4 jägerbombs please""

M: ""No problem at all I'll get right on it""

I begin to do what I've been taught to do when making drinks, do them in front of the customer. I out up 4 glasses and measure out a shot of jäger in a jiggler (25ml measuring cup) and pour it into the first glass

K: ""Aren't we supposed to get that in a shot glass inside the glass?""

M: ""We don't do it like that here due to the shot glasses being actual glass and we don't want one to break for you to swallow glass""

K: ""Well that's how I want it""

M: ""I'm sorry madam I can't do it like that""

K: ""But that measurement is smaller than a shot glass!""

M: ""I can assure you it is not. They are both 25ml""

K continued to insist I was cheating her out of alcohol and the rest of her group was getting a bit uncomfortable and restless, presuming they just wanted to have their drinks and sit down. So I grabbed a shot glass and tipped out the jäger into the shot glass and, surprise surprise, it came right to the brim. 

M: ""Is there anything else I can get you?""

She said a multitude of mixers including a berry gin and lemonade and I set about making them. I finished making them in front of her and she pointed at one and said ""is that the berry gin and lemonade?"" To which I realised I had given her the wrong gin.

M: ""My apologies I've used the wrong gin, let me quickly make you the one you ordered""

K: ""Why cant I have that one?""

M: ""Instead of the berry gin?""

K: ""No I want this for free and the berry gin""

M: ""I'm sorry I can't allow that it's not policy to do it that way""

K: ""Well what are you going to do with it?""

M: ""I'm going to tip it away and write it on a wastage sheet then make you the correct one""

K: ""Well that's a waste won't you get in trouble with your boss?""

M: ""Not at all, she understands things like this happen""

And then she said the golden line that earned her this name

K: ""I want to speak to your manager""

M: ""Are you sure she's only going to say the same thing as I did""

K: ""Yes I'm sure""

So I walk downstairs to the other bar, and remember when I said it was busy, it was about 5 people deep all the way along the bar which could have about 12 staff on comfortably. My manager (A) was clearly having a bad evening of people complaining and her not being able to do anything about it so her eyes lit up when she got the chance to come off of that bar and up to mine to have a go at a customer for being rude to her staff. She followed me back up and I pointed out K who had moved to a table and she went over to speak with her. I didn't hear the conversation but was told afterwards by A that she said exactly what I said to them but a lot more sternly and with a rather large bouncer behind her and she then charged them for the drinks they bought at an apparent discount but actually included twat tax which went back to me as a tip so thank you to K who got me a drink after work and a McDonald's on my way home. 


I understand it's not quite as bad as some others experiences but this one has really just stuck with me. But to counter this I've had countless kind, polite, understanding, patient, funny, nice customers so I don't dwell on this but it's a funny story to tell and shows me exactly how not to perform as a customer to people working in customer service jobs","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small bit of context before I have a rant about my worst customer experience (the exchange is as best remembered as I can as this was a few months ago).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my final year of my degree I worked at a bar part time on weekends to earn some extra money. This was a higher class bar that advertised towards business people and not the student population of the city. In this bar there were two separate bars: the main one downstairs with your standard on-tap beers and ciders, basic mixer drinks, and some top-shelf alcohol and the bar upstairs being the cocktail bar with basic mixers, cocktails, expensive champagne, and more top-shelf alcohol. I worked on the cocktail bar when this event took place. We shall call the lady in question K from now on and that&amp;#39;ll become clear later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a busy weekend night at the other bar when B and her group came to my bar. Due to my bar being less busy I came over to see her straight away&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Good evening guys what can I get for you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: &amp;quot;4 jägerbombs please&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;quot;No problem at all I&amp;#39;ll get right on it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I begin to do what I&amp;#39;ve been taught to do when making drinks, do them in front of the customer. I out up 4 glasses and measure out a shot of jäger in a jiggler (25ml measuring cup) and pour it into the first glass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: &amp;quot;Aren&amp;#39;t we supposed to get that in a shot glass inside the glass?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t do it like that here due to the shot glasses being actual glass and we don&amp;#39;t want one to break for you to swallow glass&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: &amp;quot;Well that&amp;#39;s how I want it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry madam I can&amp;#39;t do it like that&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: &amp;quot;But that measurement is smaller than a shot glass!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;quot;I can assure you it is not. They are both 25ml&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K continued to insist I was cheating her out of alcohol and the rest of her group was getting a bit uncomfortable and restless, presuming they just wanted to have their drinks and sit down. So I grabbed a shot glass and tipped out the jäger into the shot glass and, surprise surprise, it came right to the brim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: &amp;quot;Why cant I have that one?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: &amp;quot;No I want this for free and the berry gin&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;quot;Not at all, she understands things like this happen&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then she said the golden line that earned her this name&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: &amp;quot;Yes I&amp;#39;m sure&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

\---ME: actually me (/u/DuchessOfQuimm ) IRL. AKA Myself or I. – did have an ABRA license –

Important note: all bars/restaurants/concert venues/beer gardens/weird hipster watering holes must have BOTH an ABRA-issued license for the establishment itself (and be in compliance with all stipulations of their license type) AND one human being present during ALL operating hours who is individually licensed as an ABRA manager in order to be in compliance with the law.

This occurred one fall evening, shortly after I’d gotten married—I’d been working as the beverage director at this fine dining spot in Washington DC for a little over a year and in that time had to assume the General Manager role with very little notice or preparation and subsequently had to later train my own boss-to-be, keep the restaurant running, and actually attend to my real beverage director duties.

I typically worked 60-70 hour weeks, like all FOH managers in big city fine dining establishments, I suppose—but after getting married, I promised myself and my new husband that I would make spending time at home with him a priority—so, I took off one much needed Friday evening. Mind you, I did not take off for the entire Friday—I wouldn’t dream of doing such a thing: I came in to receive, label, organize, and put away about 40 cases of wine; attended the manager meeting and ran the floor while the other managers attended to some administrative work and pre-service duties; I held lineup complete with wine training then went home at 5pm.

Since beginning work at this restaurant, I had only taken off one other Friday and it was the day of the rehearsal dinner for my wedding. So on this night, we were “celebrating” finally having a full management staff so both the GM, Casey, and myself were off leaving the Private Dining Coordinator (not named above), the floor manager (Karen), and our newly-minted Assistant General Manager (Lou) to look after dinner service. In the name of this celebration-worthy occasion, I went to dinner with my husband, ate too much, drank too much, and was getting ready to slip into a glorious food coma on my couch when my phone rang—it was the restaurant.

My hubby did not have to say a thing—the look on his face said it all as he read the name of my restaurant flash across the screen of my phone: DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT ANSWERING THAT THING.

I didn’t answer it. I was said aloud, “Screw it, I’m unavailable. How do they know I’m not in a movie or in jail or something?” 

I engaged the “do not disturb” feature on my phone and we continued watching TV---then his phone rang; we ignored it. Then his phone rang again: my husband was listed as an emergency contact for my workplace—I knew that the restaurant calling *him*  when I was off and didn’t answer my own phone meant that the restaurant was on fire, someone was severely injured, and/or some sort of required operating license was in real peril. 

I grabbed my phone and called the restaurant bank:

“ {\[ME\]} IS THAT YOU?”—a frantic Karen half-shouted on the other end of the phone.

“Yeah—let me guess. ABRA is there?”

“Yes. But—“

“Oh. My. God. I knew it. This is what I get for taking a Friday, right? We all said this wouldn’t happen and here we are. Honestly, I’m a little hammered but I guess I’ll get an Uber---“

“NO!” 

“HUH?”  I said--shocked. 

“Casey is here, you don’t have to come right now but, um—“

“Karen, sweetie, I love you and I’m sorry that you had to deal with that tonight—like, REALLY, I am--but why the fuck are you calling me if he’s there?” 

“Well, something else happened—“

Again, my stomach sank.

“Well, what in the actual fuck? Go ahead…”

“Well, ABRA came in at like 9:45, \[the other manager\] left like fifteen minutes before and I'd been watching the door. I saw the two guys in black and told Lou that I saw them and asked what to do since neither of you guys were here. He told me to go to the office and get the copy we have on file of your ABRA license and to say that I was you---“

*Now---This is objectively really pretty horrifying already, right? Well, dig this: Karen is Puerto Rican and fits a Sophia Vergara sort of face and body type with luxurious thick dark hark hair, I am a semi-curvy/athletic-ish VERY pale person who has sported curls since high school and at the time I had “I Love Lucy” red hair. See also: Karen was about seven months pregnant when this occurred. Pregnancy brain and the general stress of the situation was not a great recipe for recalling and reciting details about one’s coworkers life, especially in a manner that would convince an official that this was her own information. (Not to mention—imagine if this had worked? How confused would I have been when ABRA came in for a recheck in a few months and asked how my baby is?)*

“Oh NO”

“Oh yes. I did what he said and gave the ABRA guy the license copy while the other guy looked around—Lou had already told them that I ‘left my wallet at home and didn’t have the actual card but that we keep a copy on file just in case of this sort of situation.’ The guy said that as long as he could ‘confirm my information’ we should be ok.

“Oh NO.”

“Oh yes—I did okay at first. 'What’s your middle name?' I knew it was Marie. 'What’s your date of birth?' I knew it was 12/23 but stumbled for a second on the 86—I recovered well from that, though. Then he asked me your address—“

“OH NO”

“I have driven you home at least a dozen times and I have looked at your address in my phone each time while GPSing and all that I could come up with was ‘Seventeen Something North East,’"" she trailed off...,""I am so sorry!”

“Karen. THIS is NOT on you!”

“I tried to laugh it off and say something about pregnancy brain and then he asked my zip code and all I could give him was the restaurant zip code. The guy kept looking back and forth between the paper and my face and then Casey arrived.”

“OH?!” *(Was this terror? Relief? Casey was our boss so this was not exactly the best impression but also, Lou the new AGM was Casey’s ‘boy’ \[for those of you old enough to remember the movie “Old School,” Casey habitually referred to Lou as “HE’S MY BOY, BLUE” ---and when I say habitually, I mean ALL THE DAMN TIME. All the damn time from a clammy, pale, chubby, awkward, partially bald guy who enjoyed nothing more in the world than baseball and really fantastic service at restaurants---and wine\] from their previous place of employ. Lou &amp; I had some mutual friends and I knew of some drug/alcohol/crazy ex issues from his past—but, then again, everybody had those.)*

Karen went on for several minutes about the various terrible lies and jokes told by Casey in his feeble attempts to charm the ABRA guys and I completely zoned out---I listened for the words “fired” or “suspended” but honestly, to this day, I have no idea exactly what she said in those few minutes. 

“So…there weren’t any guests there when this all went down?” I stammered. 

“No, and neither was Lou when it was all said and done. He just peaced out while Casey was talking to the ABRA guys.”

Lou only set foot in the restaurant one more time after this incident--he came in for a meeting with Casey and Casey's boss who had come down from Restaurant Overlord Central Office in NYC to issue punishment accordingly and closely hover over service that evening. Lou worked that night and then we never saw or heard from him again. I don't even know if he got a last paycheck. 

The end of the story involves a Lou getting arrested as part of an eviction process which kept him from coming into work---of course, that turned out to be completely false. Lou was fired---oddly, I was also eventually fired by this establishment as well (though, based on this and the other hundred or odd similar incidents I handled while working there, I think I deserve knighthood) and we all went our separate ways. No “happily ever after here;” just stranger than fiction levels of semi-traumatic weird shit.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;--names changed—- (duh)&lt;/p&gt;

So on this night, we were “celebrating” finally having a full management staff so both the GM, Casey, and myself were off leaving the Private Dining Coordinator (not named above), the floor manager (Karen), and our newly-minted Assistant General Manager (Lou) to look after dinner service. In the name of this celebration-worthy occasion, I went to dinner with my husband, ate too much, drank too much, and was getting ready to slip into a glorious food coma on my couch when my phone rang—it was the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hubby did not have to say a thing—the look on his face said it all as he read the name of my restaurant flash across the screen of my phone: DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT ANSWERING THAT THING.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t answer it. I was said aloud, “Screw it, I’m unavailable. How do they know I’m not in a movie or in jail or something?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I engaged the “do not disturb” feature on my phone and we continued watching TV---then his phone rang; we ignored it. Then his phone rang again: my husband was listed as an emergency contact for my workplace—I knew that the restaurant calling &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;  when I was off and didn’t answer my own phone meant that the restaurant was on fire, someone was severely injured, and/or some sort of required operating license was in real peril. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my phone and called the restaurant bank:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ {[ME]} IS THAT YOU?”—a frantic Karen half-shouted on the other end of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah—let me guess. ABRA is there?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes. But—“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh. My. God. I knew it. This is what I get for taking a Friday, right? We all said this wouldn’t happen and here we are. Honestly, I’m a little hammered but I guess I’ll get an Uber---“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“NO!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“HUH?”  I said--shocked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Casey is here, you don’t have to come right now but, um—“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Karen, sweetie, I love you and I’m sorry that you had to deal with that tonight—like, REALLY, I am--but why the fuck are you calling me if he’s there?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, something else happened—“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, my stomach sank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, what in the actual fuck? Go ahead…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, ABRA came in at like 9:45, [the other manager] left like fifteen minutes before and I&amp;#39;d been watching the door. I saw the two guys in black and told Lou that I saw them and asked what to do since neither of you guys were here. He told me to go to the office and get the copy we have on file of your ABRA license and to say that I was you---“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now---This is objectively really pretty horrifying already, right? Well, dig this: Karen is Puerto Rican and fits a Sophia Vergara sort of face and body type with luxurious thick dark hark hair, I am a semi-curvy/athletic-ish VERY pale person who has sported curls since high school and at the time I had “I Love Lucy” red hair. See also: Karen was about seven months pregnant when this occurred. Pregnancy brain and the general stress of the situation was not a great recipe for recalling and reciting details about one’s coworkers life, especially in a manner that would convince an official that this was her own information. (Not to mention—imagine if this had worked? How confused would I have been when ABRA came in for a recheck in a few months and asked how my baby is?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh NO”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh yes. I did what he said and gave the ABRA guy the license copy while the other guy looked around—Lou had already told them that I ‘left my wallet at home and didn’t have the actual card but that we keep a copy on file just in case of this sort of situation.’ The guy said that as long as he could ‘confirm my information’ we should be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh NO.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh yes—I did okay at first. &amp;#39;What’s your middle name?&amp;#39; I knew it was Marie. &amp;#39;What’s your date of birth?&amp;#39; I knew it was 12/23 but stumbled for a second on the 86—I recovered well from that, though. Then he asked me your address—“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“OH NO”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have driven you home at least a dozen times and I have looked at your address in my phone each time while GPSing and all that I could come up with was ‘Seventeen Something North East,’&amp;quot; she trailed off...,&amp;quot;I am so sorry!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Karen. THIS is NOT on you!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I tried to laugh it off and say something about pregnancy brain and then he asked my zip code and all I could give him was the restaurant zip code. The guy kept looking back and forth between the paper and my face and then Casey arrived.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“OH?!” &lt;em&gt;(Was this terror? Relief? Casey was our boss so this was not exactly the best impression but also, Lou the new AGM was Casey’s ‘boy’ [for those of you old enough to remember the movie “Old School,” Casey habitually referred to Lou as “HE’S MY BOY, BLUE” ---and when I say habitually, I mean ALL THE DAMN TIME. All the damn time from a clammy, pale, chubby, awkward, partially bald guy who enjoyed nothing more in the world than baseball and really fantastic service at restaurants---and wine] from their previous place of employ. Lou &amp;amp; I had some mutual friends and I knew of some drug/alcohol/crazy ex issues from his past—but, then again, everybody had those.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen went on for several minutes about the various terrible lies and jokes told by Casey in his feeble attempts to charm the ABRA guys and I completely zoned out---I listened for the words “fired” or “suspended” but honestly, to this day, I have no idea exactly what she said in those few minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So…there weren’t any guests there when this all went down?” I stammered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, and neither was Lou when it was all said and done. He just peaced out while Casey was talking to the ABRA guys.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lou only set foot in the restaurant one more time after this incident--he came in for a meeting with Casey and Casey&amp;#39;s boss who had come down from Restaurant Overlord Central Office in NYC to issue punishment accordingly and closely hover over service that evening. Lou worked that night and then we never saw or heard from him again. I don&amp;#39;t even know if he got a last paycheck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the story involves a Lou getting arrested as part of an eviction process which kept him from coming into work---of course, that turned out to be completely false. Lou was fired---oddly, I was also eventually fired by this establishment as well (though, based on this and the other hundred or odd similar incidents I handled while working there, I think I deserve knighthood) and we all went our separate ways. No “happily ever after here;” just stranger than fiction levels of semi-traumatic weird shit.&lt;/p&gt;

I moved to a new city to be near family and started a new job at a busy restaurant that offered health insurance.

Well, for full-time employees. Which is what I interviewed for and was hired for. They asked me for hourly expectations and I said 40-50, they said cool. 30 is minimum for health insurance. I’m being scheduled 14-20, at first I could pick up the difference but no longer. 

Servers are scheduled for lunch or dinner there are no “swing” shifts. So you get there and wait until you get sat with tables, which may be up to an hour (this happened today, during which I ran food upstairs to a banquet for corporate trainees... no tip out). You may get 2 or 3 tables, today I got 1 table, and then was immediately cut. If this were a one-off and they just scheduled too many people and cuts are made so somebody can make money, that’s one thing. But it’s every night, around 7 all the servers will be cut except for 1 closer so they get all the tables after that, while everyone else is stuck around almost as long, doing side work. Which includes:
Drying and adding napkins to tins and dishes
Stocking food items and cleaning expo, soup and dessert stations
Running food to nontipped banquets (I don’t mind running others food and do so all shift. What I mind is they deliberately didn’t schedule anybody... “what about those servers we pay $2/hr for and are just standing around because they have no tables?? We’ll use them”)
Drying and carrying dishes from dish to line station

Another server today asked if he could clock in as SA, who make min wage, since he wasnt getting any tables and was running food for several hours, they said no. Also I have only eaten anything on the menu because I have been there, before I started working there. For staff meals we get frozen pizza rolls or corn dogs, not things that they actually have on the menu. Makes it awkward when guests ask about food recommendations.

Other servers have been nosy about my tips. I have had some shifts were I did over $150 (we also have to tip out 15%, which is fine) but it’s not often and honestly I feel like that should be my normal baseline.

So backstory: I work in a pub/night club that at capacity fits about 400 people. This was the biggest bar in our relatively small town and had been shut down for a few year prior. It had just re opened and was in its first few months of operations. It was pretty hectic for the first few months and we had up to 8 bartenders on at a time.

Anyways one Saturday this guy, we’ll call him K, comes into the bar. He walks up to one of the other bartenders, orders a corona and hands him a $100 and said “keep the change.” He ends up doing this a few times throughout the night, now this is a pretty big deal and he’s getting to0 notch service for sure, however we’ve seen stuff like this recently being the re open so this wasn’t too unheard of.

The night progress and K gets pretty wasted to say the least. He wasn’t at the point of getting cut off but it’s safe to say he’s had a good night at this point. I don’t exactly know what happened here as I was on the other side of the bar. However from what I was told K pulled out $500 and offered it to person R if person R punched K  in the face. No I did not get that backwards, K is a lunatic to say the least. He’s banned from a lot of bars around here for pulling shit like this. R proceeds to get dragged out by the bouncers right in front of me. The next thing I see is K walking up to my well I was working at. He has blood pouring out his mouth and nose at this point and obviously got hit pretty good. I was kind of in shock at this point and like “what is going on” but then K proceeds to bring out a wad of cash, all $100 and just starts making it rain on me behind the bar. He’s splitting blood up and there’s blood all over the counter and bills, everyone in the bar kinda just stopped and is like “what the fuck”. He basically walked out after that and all the money despite being covered in blood, ended up in our tip jar.


We pool our tips so I think after tip out and everything being said in done the person who made the least made about $850 and I made the most at $1350. I got covered in blood but I also have never made close to that again in my life. Still kinda shook about it to this day tbh.

So this happened last night when I was the closing server. The characters are a miserable old lady we will refer to as MOL and her friend (F)

This was my first table of the night and I was in a great mood so I went to greet the table pour them water and inquire about a drink order.

MOL: I want a Bellini! Do you know what that is?
Me: Yes miss I - MOL cuts me off mid sentence
MOL: yeah? Then what’s in it?
Me: Prosecco and peach purée miss
MOL: good that’s what I want
Me: unfortunately I’m not sure my bartender has any peach purée at the moment but I am more than happy to check for you.
F: I’ll have a Tangeray martini with the vermouth on the side
Me: absolutely olives or a twist for you miss?
F: a twist please
MOL: put olives in it too I’ll have her olives and I want 3 orange slices
Me: I’m happy to bring you some olives on the side miss
MOL: no put them in her drink and I’ll take them
Me: sorry miss I don’t want to put olives in your friends drink if she doesn’t want olives as that may change the flavor of her martini slightly but like I said I’m happy to bring you a side.

Her friend looks at me apologetically and thanks me and I go to check if we have peach purée. Generally we only use it for parties that have Bellini bars and mimosas so I ask the bartender who says no and then the pastry chef who says yes but it’s currently frozen. I’m not going to have the chef thaw out a tub of peach purée just for this ladies drink so I go back to inform her we don’t have any.

Me: sorry miss we don’t have any purée in house right now was there something else you would like.
MOL looks even more pissed off: ok I’ll have peach schnapps instead
Me: absolutely would you like that by itself or can I put it in Prosecco for you
MOL: with Prosecco obviously! It’s called a fake Bellini! But I want it in a rocks glass. Do you know what a rocks glass is?
Friend facepalms and says: I’m sure he knows what a rocks glass is
I chuckle and say of course I’ll be right back with your drinks.

I bring the drinks over and MOL looks displeased. As I drop the drinks I see I’m getting sat another table
MOL: that looks small
Me: I’m sorry you feel that way but its our standard pour miss
MOL points at glass usually it’s up to here this is small
Me: again miss our bartender does a standard pour and I just saw him fill the Prosecco glass fully before transferring it to the rocks glass. I’m happy to grab my manager for you if you would like.
MOL says it’s fine and drops an orange slice in it to make sure the Prosecco is actually carbonated (lmao) at which point she seems at least slightly satisfied. They are not ready to order so I greet my other table and come back a couple minutes later.

MOL: I’ll have the chicken livers but I don’t want them overdone I want them medium
Me: unfortunately the chef has to cook them all the way through but I am make a note for him to not over cook them
MOL: no I want medium
Me: yes miss but we are required to cook them all the way we used to serve them rare but can no longer offer them undercooked I’m very sorry
F: it’s the law!
I beam a genuine smile at the friend and tell MOL her friend is right but like I said I will tell the chef to not over cook them.

They eat and the MOL is happy with her well done chicken livers even says they are delicious (thank god)
When it comes time for the bill her friend hands me her card
MOL yells: LET ME SEE THE BILL!
Me smiling : sorry miss your friend has taken care of it.

Friend leaves me 20% and thanks me again. Luckily I was in a good mood that day and all my other tables were very nice but that one lady almost made me lose it.

It was a typical Friday night and a table comes in and orders 2 filet mignon dinners. One of those dinners was adding on an 8oz lobster tail, essentially making it a surf and turf, nothing crazy there. It was the first lobster tail and only lobster tail of the night at that point, so I remember cooking it pretty distinctly. I should also note that we sous-vide our lobster tails without the shells for a tender (though admittedly small looking) dish. 

We plate the table and a runner takes it out, no issue. About ten minutes later the server comes back and tells me that the customer never got their tail and to make them another one. At first she thought the customer was joking when he told her that, as he had a half empty butter dish that is served with the lobster right next to his plate, but he wasn't kidding. I tell her that that is bullshit and I distinctly remember plating that tail to the extent where I perfectly described the table with the steak's cooking style and temperature without even looking for a ticket. She believes me and gets a manager. 

The manager comes in to assess the situation and I tell her that the customer got the tail and to check the security cameras if she doesn't believe me. This lobster tail is a $30 add-on and I refuse to just give it away. After a while she does what all our managers eventually do and she just gives  in. She takes the lobster tail off their order, giving this guy and the magician with the disappearing lobster exactly what he wanted. 

Did she ever check the security footage like I told her? Yeah, the next day. Did the customer have a lobster tail on his plate? Yes he did.

Hell no, we're just going to give in like we always do...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one happened just the other week and is another baffling example of why you should never say the customer is always right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a typical Friday night and a table comes in and orders 2 filet mignon dinners. One of those dinners was adding on an 8oz lobster tail, essentially making it a surf and turf, nothing crazy there. It was the first lobster tail and only lobster tail of the night at that point, so I remember cooking it pretty distinctly. I should also note that we sous-vide our lobster tails without the shells for a tender (though admittedly small looking) dish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plate the table and a runner takes it out, no issue. About ten minutes later the server comes back and tells me that the customer never got their tail and to make them another one. At first she thought the customer was joking when he told her that, as he had a half empty butter dish that is served with the lobster right next to his plate, but he wasn&amp;#39;t kidding. I tell her that that is bullshit and I distinctly remember plating that tail to the extent where I perfectly described the table with the steak&amp;#39;s cooking style and temperature without even looking for a ticket. She believes me and gets a manager. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manager comes in to assess the situation and I tell her that the customer got the tail and to check the security cameras if she doesn&amp;#39;t believe me. This lobster tail is a $30 add-on and I refuse to just give it away. After a while she does what all our managers eventually do and she just gives  in. She takes the lobster tail off their order, giving this guy and the magician with the disappearing lobster exactly what he wanted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did she ever check the security footage like I told her? Yeah, the next day. Did the customer have a lobster tail on his plate? Yes he did. Are we going to learn from this event and be better prepared if this again, especially with the same customer? Hell no, we&amp;#39;re just going to give in like we always do...&lt;/p&gt;

Okay rant over :) 

What to take away from this story: If you're finished just tell someone! If no one's noticed or even if someone has seen your plates are almost done but you ain't gonna finish just say something otherwise they might not come over. Also if you don't ask then you're not gonna get.

Description of a Runner : So a runner in the pizza place I work at does everything a server does apart from taking orders, printing bills, scanning coupons, taking drink/dessert orders, making/serving drinks/desserts (Apart from tap water).

My main jobs are serving food so everyone gets it while it's hot and clearing tables.

&lt;p&gt;The man shook his head. &amp;quot;No it&amp;#39;s alright. The kitchen is still in the swing of cooking. It&amp;#39;s no problem. You&amp;#39;ve got plenty of time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people would&amp;#39;ve been mad had we come in 30 minutes before closing on a snowy day. But this guy (and all his coworkers) were very nice and didn&amp;#39;t rush us at all. We apologized for coming in so late and they said we didnt have to but appreciated it.&lt;/p&gt;

I eventually relent, but mention to the person paying I will be charging them for the OJ (I was gonna give him one free because I didnt care to find out what one splash of OJ would cost). Which they say is fine.

Also never posted before on reddit before and on mobile so forgive formatting issues please. 

It was a busy sat night and a 7top came in late in the Eve (maybe 10ish) and wanted to sit on the patio which was my section. I was hoping to be cut earlier in the night but I kept getting sat on the patio so I decided to just keep smiling amd wait it out. The closing server also didn't feel well and had almost no tables inside so I went ahead and decided to stay and close for him. It had been so busy that night I hadn't even looked at some of the dessert specials as none of my tables had asked about them. 

Anyway, the 7 top sits down and orders 4 beers or so. They ask about our mini desserts and I apologize and tell them I will have to double check what flavors are available as sometimes we run out/ change during busy nights. I go and do so and tell them and they hardly pay attention to me amd tell me they will order dessert later. I give them some time and check on them multiple times ( all while I have 6 other tables I'm running around for) when I come back they ask me about the cheesecake flavors. I inform them it is NY style today with either blueberry or raspberry sauce. The man aegues with me saying the menu states there are multiple cheesecakes. It doesn't, we make rotating flavors and only one is available at a time. He asks me to double check. So I go back to the kitchen, check, go back to his table and inform him it is indeed NY style with Blubery sauce. 

He then says, ""That's nice, but $8 for a slice of cheesecake if just too much so I won't be getting any."" The rest of the table orders 1 dessert (no food) and no beer refils. They've now been here over two hours. The man also remarks before I leave their table, ""Wow I guess that was a lot of work for nothing then, huh?"" I just laugh and remark thats it's really no trouble.

When I collect their recipts after they left one person tipped $3 and two others tipped $1 each. They were there for over 2 and 1/2 hours. 

Just a bizarre and frustrating story. Also why wouldn't you just tip more if you realize your server did a bunch of work and then you decided to only order 4 beers and 1 dessert?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happened a week or so ago but I keep thinking about it. &lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been in the service industry for about 3 years back when I started working at the age of 16. I post this because i just need some advice because I am financially stressed out. When I started working in this industry I started as a meat carver in a Brazilian restaurant. Money was great for my age as I could easily make $15+ an hour and being in high school at the time, it was the best thing I could have asked for. Now I’ve stayed with this company for about two years and throughout this time I became Lead Meat Carver, Lead Server, trained as Bartender, and became Supervisor. Now I will say that I did leave for a month to try out retail but then came back because it was just so boring. When I came back one month later I became supervisor. It was all going great but I started to feel bored and having to tip Pool my tips and wait every paycheck to get them on top of being taxed started to get old. Now I had another friend working at a very successful restaurant who would always make bank as a server and get his tips in cash at the end of every shift and this just seemed like the best thing ever for me. What I did like any other naive 19 year old college student was apply and hope that my friend would put in a good word for me(which he did). I applied as a server, host,and bidder but I aimed for server as this is were you get the most money. I got a call saying that the only position available was being a host and in my mind I said fuck it I’ll be promoted eventually and left my job for a second time . I got the job and started June of 2019. The job was alright put the pay is just terrible. I went from earning $20+ an hour in my high position at my other restaurant to making $8 an hour plus an average of $30 dollars extra in tips. Now I pay tuition and some bills despite living with my mom and helping her with whatever she needs in the house and honestly the money is just not enough. This job said I can start “cross training” meaning I’ll still be mostly a host from 4-6 months after I got hired. What struck some low blows for me from this place was that 2 weeks after I got hired here they hired a new server, 2 weeks later and another server got hired. Fast forward 3 weeks more and another server got hired whom he had no experience. I felt offended by this but brushed off saying this is just how things are. It’s been 4 months and I hate being a host and money is so tight right now that I just don’t know what to do. When I left my previous job, the owner told me that I was always welcomed to come back and that I will always have a job available. I guess that in top of that most of my friends work at the Brazilian restaurant I left plus I have a few family members including my brother. Do you guys think it would be wise of me to return to this work place where I know I can make more money? Even though it has its bs like any other restaurant it’s what I learned and know the most of. Or should I stick with this current restaurant a few more months to see what happens?

Only 3 tables and 2 people at the bar. One of those tables being us. Everything took forever because I could never find the waiter who was laughing with coworkers in the back.

Another drink .....5 minutes and then it took long to get made. A Gin and tonic takes 2 seconds to make especially with an empty bar

Waiter also forgot to put in a side of veg ( not a big deal since we wound up not even having room for it)

I got them a beer and a cocktail, took their order for an appetizer and dropped some bread off at their table while they waited for their food to come out. While I was away, they stopped my boyfriend and asked him if there was egg in the bread, not telling him their baby was severely allergic.

I didn’t know so I went to ask our head chef that orders the bread and he said yes, there is egg in our bread. I casually walk back to the table and tell them what I was told. The mother immediately drops what she was holding and grabs an epi pen out of her bag and tells me about her baby’s severe allergy. I immediately grab my manager to tell her what happened and as she goes to talk to the family, I have to tell my boyfriend what he accidentally did.

So it was the night before halloween. The cafeteria I used to work at always decorated the whole inside a few weeks before and then redecorated it the night before to surprise the customers and especially childern. (I know a bit unpractical but I´m happy my boss did that)

We were towards the end of our shift. I was cleaning the bar and such while my friend and coworker was outside smoking, another waiter chatting with one of the few tables remaining and my boss was in the saloon redecorating everything.

I just pured 2 Jack &amp; cokes and left the empty bottle on the counter and wanted to start refilling the coolers when suddently a guy ran in through the front door screaming to call the police because somebody wanted to kill him. 

I was surprised at first and stood there in shock but ¨woke up¨ when the guy entered behind the bar. I tried to calm him down and told him to go to the bathroom and lock himself up while we call the police.

I´ve almost got him out of my bar when suddently another guy stormed in. ¨You fucked my wife and daughter¨ Owww boy that just got reeeally interesting.

Trying to get the first guy out from my bar I heard behind me my boss coming out from the saloon to see what is happening. In that moment the 2nd guy took a bottle of Heineken (I even remember the damn brand) and threw it on the guy. He pulled me and tried to use me as a shield. I pushed him away and ducked down not to get hit cause I saw the other guy reaching for the empty Jack bottle. 

I could feel it scratching my head as it passed by and made a huge hole in the cardboard door separating the bar from the kitchen. I ran out crouching out from there and went into the saloon where my boss and a customer were hiding. 

Those sons of b\*\*\*\*\*s destrioyed the main glass door, made a hole in the marmour bar, smashed over 60 full bottles, destroyed around 20 ashtrays (which I just fucking cleaned, dried and pilled up on the bar) and a container of almonds in salt and oil which made a huge mess together with all the glass.

After somebody screamed the police will be soon the 2nd guy ran off while the first guy who I think has balls made out of damn steel got out from the bar, cleaned up a chair from the glass pieces and sat down while lighting up a cigarrete. 

The police came but for some reason didn´t take him to the police station even though he didn´t even had his ID on him to show to the cops. They just... let him walk free while questioning us more than they did him. 

We don´t had security camaras at that time so we had to explain everything to the police. 

After a week we´ve been called to the police station to identify those two and found out they are brothers in law. Their christmas dinner has to be fun.

Ohh and the best thing? Insurance wouldn´t pay shit cause they didn´t come with the intention to destroy the bar but eachother.

Ftp and all the jazz, sorry about format am on mobile. For Context:

Me: a tired manager 
R: my very busy waiter, who guests frequently rave about
DH: Dick Head 

Also our company policy is any tables of 5+ covers get an optional 10% service charge added on to their bill ...


So, Sunday’s at our place are crazy 1pm-6pm packed out like crazy, this means we are all running around in weeds trying to do our best. Around 3pm we have a 5 top come in family of 4 and their disabled son. Orders taken yadadada, I end up running mains over to them, seem like a lovely family, joke around with them abit with R all going well.

I’m on my way to the potwash when DH stops me and asks me for the bill, no worries I dump my plates and print it for him. About 5 minutes later I see DH all up in R’s face going crazy, I catch R’s eye and I run over to intervene.

Me: Hiya sir is everything alright? 

DH: No it’s F**cking not! I’ve been charged service on my bill for 5 people! Only 4 of us are eating and my son is disabled this is a disgrace!

R: Sir that’s because when we enter covers..

DH: (cutting off R) I always tip well anyway! But this is ridiculous using my son as a 5th person just to get us to pay service! (This is the uk btw so our tipping culture is pretty much nonexistent)

Me : Okay we are very sorry about that, but as you can see on your receipt, it is only an optional service charge so you are in no way forced to pay it. 

DH: But that’s not the point you are being prejudice against my DISABLED SON!

Me: All due respect sir.. we enter our covers based on the amount of people around the table, and god forbid we don’t treat your son as a human. 

R has slipped away at this point to take care of his section. DH’s really embarrassed wife and kids have also left.. they had already paid so I refunded him, took the service off of their bill ... showed the DH the new total and he paid again, all while threatening that if he’s been charged twice he’s ringing our head office and I’m finished. And here’s the kicker the bill was £55... the service charge came to a whopping £5.50.


So TL:DR: Angry dude tries to use his sons disability not to pay a £5 tip.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Guys! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: All due respect sir.. we enter our covers based on the amount of people around the table, and god forbid we don’t treat your son as a human. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R has slipped away at this point to take care of his section. DH’s really embarrassed wife and kids have also left.. they had already paid so I refunded him, took the service off of their bill ... showed the DH the new total and he paid again, all while threatening that if he’s been charged twice he’s ringing our head office and I’m finished. And here’s the kicker the bill was £55... the service charge came to a whopping £5.50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So TL:DR: Angry dude tries to use his sons disability not to pay a £5 tip.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m on mobile lol

I recently got hired at a lawyer’s office and am excited as it will definitely get me closer where I want to be after I graduate college. I have been told I can start whenever my two weeks notice at my hostess job is up (which is very gracious). However, I’m horrified to do it. 

I have a really great relationship with my GM and I’ve been working there since April of 2018. Not to mention she herself is leaving the restaurant at the end of the year for a better job. I am the lead hostess and they rely on me SO much to work busy nights and weekends. I considered moving up to serving, but my managers didn’t ever schedule me to train after they said they would. This is what really triggered me to see what else was out there.  I’m ready to put my two weeks in and I’m excited to do so despite my fear about it. I also feel like I have a good reason to quit. 

All in all, I like my coworkers and my work environment most of the time, but it’s too high-stress for what I’m being paid and the customers are getting on my last nerve. I cried in my car during my break this weekend because I’m so ready to move on from the service industry since Ive been doing so since i was 16. 

TLDR: My main fear of quitting comes from blindsiding my manager. It scares me to just pull her aside out of the blue and give my notice so suddenly, since I have given her NO hints toward me leaving or wanting to do so any time soon. For all she knows, I’m completely happy and content. I know I want to give my notice face-to-face and not just with a letter. Do I just ask her if I can talk to her privately at the end of my shift? Do I text/email her ahead of time and ask if I can talk to her? I just don’t know the best (least anxiety inducing) way to go about this. I really don’t want to chicken out and leave for the day without speaking to her. 

Also, my schedule is already out past the two weeks. I’m sure this doesn’t matter, but is it disrespectful to not work those shifts after my two weeks is up?

Lets go ahead set the setting a lil more

* Owner- Carly
* Antagonist- Linda
* Manager- Ashley
* Hosts- Carol &amp; Jen

I recently got a new serving job at a fine dining wine bar with fresh seafood. a gourmet cheese room, sushi bar, and scratch kitchen (?) Its just a part time gig to get myself more experience, as in my other job I serve very fast casual american fare with a lot of tables, but with very low daily tip potential. I work each job every other day and then have Sundays off. Keeps my days from feeling repetitive. Only working there 2 days a week and I've worked there 7 nights.

Linda has also been here for about 2 1/2 weeks, but she works here 4-5 days a week. I've known for awhile Linda doesn't like me very much. One of the last times I worked with Linda she was on a bar-tending shift and hadn't been getting out my drinks, had a table wait 15 minutes for a glass of wine but she wouldn't allow me behind bar, then started to loudly argue with me about whether or not I sent them in, when I found the ticket for my drink 'punched' as a completed order she loudly chastised me for ""being unprofessional in-front of customers and embarrassing my self at the work place"". I very sternly said something along the lines of 'Aint that the pot calling the kettle black, "" and just kinda walked away. At the end of the night I made 115, I had to tip out dish, host, &amp; bar. I decided 5$ a piece was fair enough, considering my total, and left. Keep in mind, this is a small gourmet restaurant, on nights we arnt busy, servers do our own dishes and bar, and dont do tip outs. If its slow hosts &amp; dish go home early w/o tips.

The next shift I had, Linda wasn't there, but Jen was. Jen went on to tell me that Linda told her directly that she didnt think Jen deserved tips for her job, and that it was ridiculous because that money should be going to bar. Jen told me, with out prompting, that she heard how Linda talked to me the last time we worked together and that she really didnt think that it was acceptable, but didnt want to add flame to the fire by saying something.

I come into work Thursday and we were clearly overstaffed, I was the last one on rotation, got there at 4pm, and by 7:00 i'd taken one to go order. The couple was incredibly nice and thankful though, repetitively said how helpful and thoughtful I was at explaining the menu, tipped me 6$ on one sushi entree and a bottle of home made salad dressing. Promised they'd come back soon and request me as their server even. Good people. After they left, I grabbed a staff drink, and said ""l8r""

Well, today, Saturday, Linda was again, at bar, Pretty much as soon as I came in, Jen found a moment to pull me aside and tell me that while I was at my other job Friday, Linda made a complaint about Jen and I. The owner Carly had already pulled Jen aside to talk to her about it, and Jen heard my name wrapped up in it so wanted to give me a heads up. Jen told me that she thinks Linda is an absolute bully and that its really upsetting her. Carly asks to speak to me for a moment in her office, but suddenly a customer calls and asks to speak to the owner, Guess who it was, It was the nice to go order people, who just decided to call two days later to by the owners words ""rant and rave about your service"". I couldn't believe my luck. Carly shook my hand and told me I did a really good job, and never talked to me about Lindas complaints. I immediately realized that knowing about Lindas complaints, but having management NOT know that I know was powerful information that I could use to my advantage, if needed.

My shift goes on and Linda is SUPER irate all evening, I went out of my way to sell full bottles of wine as much as I could so that I wouldnt have to worry about her making my drinks, and got quite a few glasses of my own wine while she was servicing tables. At one point, I accidentally rung in a pinot noir even though it was 86'd and she flipped out. Even the owners husband was very lightly telling her it wasnt a big deal and was picking out an inexpensive pinot from the wine room. She kept going on, and I finally looked at her and just said ""I'm really going to need you to be nicer to me"", grabbed the bottle offered, and walked off. Not long after Im walking behind her in a walkway, and with out realizing im there, she says to her self mockingly ""iM GoInG To NeEd YoU tO bE NiCeR"". Later in the evening, as im holding a very heavy tray, she holds a door open for me, and as im rather focused, I didnt think to say thank you, she very loudly goes ""Uh Huh, You're Welcome!"" Just kinda dumb rude stuff, a 55 year old woman working customer service should have more tact.

At this point, I'm kinda just like, what do I have to lose, I've worked here for 7 days. I got the manager Ashley alone and pulled a very innocent, "" Hey, I hate to be this person, I know you have a lot going on right now, but Linda has been being really harsh to me, and its gotten bad enough that I have Jen and Carly both coming up to me saying that they arnt okay with how shes speaking to me. "". Ashley said that she'd seen it her self a bit, and that she would mention it with out mentioning that i brought it up, and told me that they really like having me there and not to worry about it. About ten minutes later I see and vaguely hear Linda saying things about my service, work ethic, and making a bunch of her like ""you see?"" gestures. I rung in a drink to go back to bar to be annoying and nosy, basically, and Linda shut up pretty quickly.

The night goes on and closing time is afoot, Linda keeps repetitively asking if I've printed my revenue yet, and at first I couldn't understand why. As soon as i printed out my report, she circles my total beer sales, total wine glass sales, and total wine bottle sales and tells me that those are the numbers i should be using to calculate her tip out. Keep in mind, I went out of my way to sell bottles of wine so I could avoid using her ""service"" and sold 200$ worth of just wine bottles, which was half of my total sales on this slow night. I ended up with a shit section filled with just friends of the local band that was singing, they all shared bottles of wine and apps;  I'll add, I'm new enough that asking how to do tip outs based on total drink sales was really reasonable, especially as its not restaurant policy.  I grabbed my report, all of my tips, walked up to the manager to turn in my cash for the night and in the most innocent voice I could muster up,

""Mam, What would the proper tip to bar be based on my total drink sales?""-""Honestly, on a night like tonight, you dont even need to tip bar, we all just kinda helped each other out all night, you got some of your own drinks"" -""Oh, well, Linda said I need to be calculating her tip based on my total drink sales""-""Well, no one would ever expect you to tip based on your full bottles of wine"" - ""Oh, I think she expects me too, could you just tell me how much you think I should tip her out, so I know I didnt do it incorrectly?"" - \*does some quick math\*, ""Based on your beer and wine glass sales, 5% of total sales would be about 6$""- ""Thanks :)""

I grabbed out 6$, placed it on the bar, and with out saying anything to Linda, walked into the dish pit/backroom to finish my drink, I hear Linda stomping around and approach the manager with attitude.

L: ""She just completely stiffed me on a tip""-""No, She didnt""- ""I calculated how much I should have been tipped based on her revenue report, She completely stiffed me and walked out"" - ""I also, just calculated how much she should have been tipping you. Except, I figured it should have been Zero. The way youre acting is completely unprofessional, You shouldn't be calculating anything on anyones revenue reports. We aren't going to schedule you for the next week, after that we can see if you can play nice with coworkers. ""

I left my drink at dish &amp; headed out the back door to avoid confrontation, but had the pleasure of seeing Linda stomp to her car in a hissy fit. Never have I ever seen Karma act so swiftly in my favor. Never have I ever had such a random idea go so well. Everything just kinda lined up in my favor. If i hadn't had been able to push the full bottles of wine; the disagreement over whether or not I needed to tip out on bottles wouldn't have happened. If those customers had called any later, Carly would have had the meeting where she told me i was on ""thin ice"" like Jen due to Lindas complaint.

Instead, I kinda just cast reflect, but I look innocent &amp; spooked

It just felt nice, wanted to share, thanks for reading,","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cant tell short stories for the life of me, so apologies in advance, I like -context- its a blessing and a curse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets go ahead set the setting a lil more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owner- Carly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antagonist- Linda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manager- Ashley&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosts- Carol &amp;amp; Jen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently got a new serving job at a fine dining wine bar with fresh seafood. a gourmet cheese room, sushi bar, and scratch kitchen (?) Its just a part time gig to get myself more experience, as in my other job I serve very fast casual american fare with a lot of tables, but with very low daily tip potential. I work each job every other day and then have Sundays off. Keeps my days from feeling repetitive. Only working there 2 days a week and I&amp;#39;ve worked there 7 nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linda has also been here for about 2 1/2 weeks, but she works here 4-5 days a week. I&amp;#39;ve known for awhile Linda doesn&amp;#39;t like me very much. One of the last times I worked with Linda she was on a bar-tending shift and hadn&amp;#39;t been getting out my drinks, had a table wait 15 minutes for a glass of wine but she wouldn&amp;#39;t allow me behind bar, then started to loudly argue with me about whether or not I sent them in, when I found the ticket for my drink &amp;#39;punched&amp;#39; as a completed order she loudly chastised me for &amp;quot;being unprofessional in-front of customers and embarrassing my self at the work place&amp;quot;. I very sternly said something along the lines of &amp;#39;Aint that the pot calling the kettle black, &amp;quot; and just kinda walked away. At the end of the night I made 115, I had to tip out dish, host, &amp;amp; bar. I decided 5$ a piece was fair enough, considering my total, and left. Keep in mind, this is a small gourmet restaurant, on nights we arnt busy, servers do our own dishes and bar, and dont do tip outs. If its slow hosts &amp;amp; dish go home early w/o tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next shift I had, Linda wasn&amp;#39;t there, but Jen was. Jen went on to tell me that Linda told her directly that she didnt think Jen deserved tips for her job, and that it was ridiculous because that money should be going to bar. Jen told me, with out prompting, that she heard how Linda talked to me the last time we worked together and that she really didnt think that it was acceptable, but didnt want to add flame to the fire by saying something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come into work Thursday and we were clearly overstaffed, I was the last one on rotation, got there at 4pm, and by 7:00 i&amp;#39;d taken one to go order. The couple was incredibly nice and thankful though, repetitively said how helpful and thoughtful I was at explaining the menu, tipped me 6$ on one sushi entree and a bottle of home made salad dressing. Promised they&amp;#39;d come back soon and request me as their server even. Good people. After they left, I grabbed a staff drink, and said &amp;quot;l8r&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, today, Saturday, Linda was again, at bar, Pretty much as soon as I came in, Jen found a moment to pull me aside and tell me that while I was at my other job Friday, Linda made a complaint about Jen and I. The owner Carly had already pulled Jen aside to talk to her about it, and Jen heard my name wrapped up in it so wanted to give me a heads up. Jen told me that she thinks Linda is an absolute bully and that its really upsetting her. Carly asks to speak to me for a moment in her office, but suddenly a customer calls and asks to speak to the owner, Guess who it was, It was the nice to go order people, who just decided to call two days later to by the owners words &amp;quot;rant and rave about your service&amp;quot;. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe my luck. Carly shook my hand and told me I did a really good job, and never talked to me about Lindas complaints. I immediately realized that knowing about Lindas complaints, but having management NOT know that I know was powerful information that I could use to my advantage, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My shift goes on and Linda is SUPER irate all evening, I went out of my way to sell full bottles of wine as much as I could so that I wouldnt have to worry about her making my drinks, and got quite a few glasses of my own wine while she was servicing tables. At one point, I accidentally rung in a pinot noir even though it was 86&amp;#39;d and she flipped out. Even the owners husband was very lightly telling her it wasnt a big deal and was picking out an inexpensive pinot from the wine room. She kept going on, and I finally looked at her and just said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m really going to need you to be nicer to me&amp;quot;, grabbed the bottle offered, and walked off. Not long after Im walking behind her in a walkway, and with out realizing im there, she says to her self mockingly &amp;quot;iM GoInG To NeEd YoU tO bE NiCeR&amp;quot;. Later in the evening, as im holding a very heavy tray, she holds a door open for me, and as im rather focused, I didnt think to say thank you, she very loudly goes &amp;quot;Uh Huh, You&amp;#39;re Welcome!&amp;quot; Just kinda dumb rude stuff, a 55 year old woman working customer service should have more tact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I&amp;#39;m kinda just like, what do I have to lose, I&amp;#39;ve worked here for 7 days. I got the manager Ashley alone and pulled a very innocent, &amp;quot; Hey, I hate to be this person, I know you have a lot going on right now, but Linda has been being really harsh to me, and its gotten bad enough that I have Jen and Carly both coming up to me saying that they arnt okay with how shes speaking to me. &amp;quot;. Ashley said that she&amp;#39;d seen it her self a bit, and that she would mention it with out mentioning that i brought it up, and told me that they really like having me there and not to worry about it. About ten minutes later I see and vaguely hear Linda saying things about my service, work ethic, and making a bunch of her like &amp;quot;you see?&amp;quot; gestures. I rung in a drink to go back to bar to be annoying and nosy, basically, and Linda shut up pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night goes on and closing time is afoot, Linda keeps repetitively asking if I&amp;#39;ve printed my revenue yet, and at first I couldn&amp;#39;t understand why. As soon as i printed out my report, she circles my total beer sales, total wine glass sales, and total wine bottle sales and tells me that those are the numbers i should be using to calculate her tip out. Keep in mind, I went out of my way to sell bottles of wine so I could avoid using her &amp;quot;service&amp;quot; and sold 200$ worth of just wine bottles, which was half of my total sales on this slow night. I ended up with a shit section filled with just friends of the local band that was singing, they all shared bottles of wine and apps;  I&amp;#39;ll add, I&amp;#39;m new enough that asking how to do tip outs based on total drink sales was really reasonable, especially as its not restaurant policy.  I grabbed my report, all of my tips, walked up to the manager to turn in my cash for the night and in the most innocent voice I could muster up,&lt;/p&gt;

I’m on mobile. 

I work at a small-town restaurant. The owner is the head chef. The building we’re in used to be a mansion in the 1910’s, and these days it’s owned by the most tight-fisted, miserly couple you could imagine who run an inn in most the building. The restaurant only takes up half of the first floor (very small) with ten tables inside and seven on the front porch. The bathroom isn’t technically in our space, and it’s single use. 

Every fall, the little town I live and work in hosts a sort of fall festival. During the festival weekend 15,000 people descend on our population 1,000 town, and it is insane. Every business in town gets as much staff as possible and gears up to be slammed out of their minds for three whole days. Ours is even better, because all the local wineries set up their booths right in front of our restaurant, so we get tons of drunk people despite being BYOB. 

So the Inn owners decided years ago that no one would be allowed to use the bathroom in the building during the festival. Not restaurant patrons, not the public, no one. They lock the doors and hold on to the keys. The owner of the restaurant agrees with this, because the bathroom is single use and “can’t handle the amount of people coming through.” “But wait!” you say, “that’s illegal! You have to have a bathroom if you’re serving food!” Ah, well, you see, one of the places the town sets up Porta Johns is on the sidewalk next to the Inn’s yard. It is, technically, on their property. Therefore, there IS a bathroom provided! Gotcha! (yes this is as stupid as it sounds)

There’s nothing I can do about the bathroom thing. There’s nothing my boss can do about the bathroom thing. Even if she wanted to, she doesn’t own the building and the Inn owners won’t let us give anyone the key to the bathroom. We have signs posted everywhere that say “No restroom for public or patron” and tried to tell people before we sat them about the issue, but we still got a lot of irate people who somehow thought this didn’t apply to them until their meal was finished. People screamed at me that they re-refused to pay until they saw the owners of the inn (who weren’t in), angrily told us that the inconvenience was coming out of our tip (despite being told it had absolutely nothing to do with us, the servers, or the restaurant), and threaten to tell everyone they knew and met to never come (none of what happens during the festival is representative of how anything usually works but go off I guess). 

I agree with the guests, honestly. The Inn owners could get a nice portable bathroom for the parking lot if it was really an issue of not being able to handle the volume, but they’re cheap as hell. The FREE bathrooms that the TOWN places are technically on their property so they gleefully shut down their bathroom and moan about how mean people are when we have to deal with the majority of the irate people. My boss is no better. She agrees with the decision to close the bathroom, and told an angry guest that all the other restaurants in town do the same (they don’t,  we checked). She’s horrible in many ways but this post isn’t about her. I had a horrible weekend slammed out of my mind, working as hard as I could to take care of people and show them a good time. I had tons of people tell me I was the best server they’d ever had, only to turn on me and scream in my face once they realized I couldn’t break rules I had nothing to do with to let them into the bathroom. Porta potties suck but it’s not my fault! I hate the festival weekend. Hopefully I move before next year. 

TL;DR: Miserly building owners decide to close the bathroom during the busiest weekend of the year. Patrons get pissed (reasonably) and punish me for it (not so reasonably).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR at the bottom. I’m on mobile. &lt;/p&gt;

This is my first post on this sub so I hope I adhere to all guidelines and rules about posting! :D

So this story literally happened tonight, I am currently working at a Taiwanese cafe that sells Boba and small Tea Snacks and usually we don't get too overwhelmingly busy. Tonight was a night like any other, not too busy, not too slow. We usually close down the restaurant at 11:30 pm and leave the restaurant by 12:00 am whenever possible. We don't mind staying past closing to close up or even to help customers out til 11:45pm, letting them order drinks to-go. We also have a sign clearly stating that the kitchen will close after 11:30pm.

However tonight, at around 11:15pm, we had a massive Hummer limo parked right in front of our restaurant. All of the service staff looked at each other in dismay since we knew we were going to be staying wayyy past 12:00am if we were to serve them. So we all decided to allow them to come in and sit, but due to our policy of our kitchen closing at 11:30pm, we informed them that we were only taking to-go orders for drinks, since our kitchen had already started closing and pouring their oil out of their fryers. The group decided this was alright and we sat them down, 18 high school students in total. I went out of my way to go up to each table and take each drink order, which totaled 16 drinks. I then placed the order, and went right to making the drinks. I got the 16 drinks out in under 20 minutes, right around 11:35pm. 

At around 11:40pm we receive a call. This call was unlike any other that I have every received and will ever receive. We had one of the groups individual message their parents to complain that our kitchen was closed and unable to serve them. The parent then called us to yell, not to complain, but to legitimate YELL at our service staff that it was unacceptable we were refusing to serve their children. 

After we had tried to explain to the parent, that A) we are entitled to our right to refuse service, and B) who are you to dictate when/how we decide to close our restaurant, she BLEW UP. She started to scream in her shrill voice that caused anyone within a 10 foot range to hear the ringing from her voice over the phone. She even threatened to report us to the Better Business Bureau for not adhering to our posted hours. We then gave up trying to explain to the parent and decided fuck it, let's serve them. So literally, right as our kitchen staff was about to leave, having closed down the kitchen, we asked them to reopen to serve 4 measly dishes that they had ordered. These 16 high schoolers then proceeded to stay in our restaurant until about 12:15am, 15 minutes AFTER closing, requiring the service staff to stay until 1am to finish closing up. 

Right before we finished closing up, I walked outside to grab a smoke and I listened in on the 16 high schoolers complaining to the one mom about the terrible service and terrible serving time. I literally almost couldn't hold it in. I busted my ass to take their orders individually, then made each drink to order, getting them out in a timely manner, even reopened the kitchen to serve them their food, and all for a 7$ tip on a 140$ bill and their complaints to their parents. I was seeing red at the point.

Points of concern: 

1) If we decided to refuse service to your children, we are allowed to do this due to our right to refuse service at ANY and ALL points of contact. 

2) If we had the courtesy to tell your children that the kitchen was closed and that they still wanted to be seated to order drinks, that is on YOUR CHILDREN for taking on that understanding.

 3) I have never, ever, ever, in my 10 years of serving customers at restaurants have ever heard, much less witnessed a child complaining to a parent that a restaurant was refusing to serve them, much much less have that parent complain to the restaurant. 

I really cannot believe that this just occurred. A whiny child, probably 16-18 years of age, calling their mom to have them call us and complain. This is the epitome of an entitled child and an entitled parent.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey ya&amp;#39;ll! This is my first post on this sub so I hope I adhere to all guidelines and rules about posting! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this story literally happened tonight, I am currently working at a Taiwanese cafe that sells Boba and small Tea Snacks and usually we don&amp;#39;t get too overwhelmingly busy. Tonight was a night like any other, not too busy, not too slow. We usually close down the restaurant at 11:30 pm and leave the restaurant by 12:00 am whenever possible. We don&amp;#39;t mind staying past closing to close up or even to help customers out til 11:45pm, letting them order drinks to-go. We also have a sign clearly stating that the kitchen will close after 11:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However tonight, at around 11:15pm, we had a massive Hummer limo parked right in front of our restaurant. All of the service staff looked at each other in dismay since we knew we were going to be staying wayyy past 12:00am if we were to serve them. So we all decided to allow them to come in and sit, but due to our policy of our kitchen closing at 11:30pm, we informed them that we were only taking to-go orders for drinks, since our kitchen had already started closing and pouring their oil out of their fryers. The group decided this was alright and we sat them down, 18 high school students in total. I went out of my way to go up to each table and take each drink order, which totaled 16 drinks. I then placed the order, and went right to making the drinks. I got the 16 drinks out in under 20 minutes, right around 11:35pm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 11:40pm we receive a call. This call was unlike any other that I have every received and will ever receive. We had one of the groups individual message their parents to complain that our kitchen was closed and unable to serve them. The parent then called us to yell, not to complain, but to legitimate YELL at our service staff that it was unacceptable we were refusing to serve their children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we had tried to explain to the parent, that A) we are entitled to our right to refuse service, and B) who are you to dictate when/how we decide to close our restaurant, she BLEW UP. She started to scream in her shrill voice that caused anyone within a 10 foot range to hear the ringing from her voice over the phone. She even threatened to report us to the Better Business Bureau for not adhering to our posted hours. We then gave up trying to explain to the parent and decided fuck it, let&amp;#39;s serve them. So literally, right as our kitchen staff was about to leave, having closed down the kitchen, we asked them to reopen to serve 4 measly dishes that they had ordered.

At my former deli job, I used to hand write food tickets and manually enter the cost into a prehistoric cash register.

Guy comes in and orders. He has been in a few times before, but I couldn’t quite remember his name, so I ask him to remind me. 

His name was Ian. 

Okay, in reality it is three letters. That’s not bad; I had seen it many times before. But for whatever reason, my pen stops writing. I honestly forgot how to spell the name. Like I said, brain no call no showed that morning.
The rest is a bit hazy. I think I had a singular remaining brain cell that tried to erase this from my memory as a defense mechanism. 

The line was still long, and for some reason I felt too embarrassed to ask, so I wrote down some letters and carried on. I think I spelled his name with an E. Like ‘E inn’. I knew it looked very wrong, so I quickly rang up his order and put up the ticket before he could see what I did. Once his order was called, he read the ticket by his food to make sure it was his. His eyes scrunch up in confusion, and he gave me a look before leaving.

Mid lunch rush a table of 4 sits down; a mom, dad and two kids both under 5. I was at the other end of my section and saw them get seated. When I finished with the table I was at I went to stop by but noticed that the woman and one kid were gone and the dad was on the phone with baby on his lap. Obviously not a good time to swing by so I chose to come back. I went to ring in the order of the table I was previously at and grab them some presets on my way back to my section. At this point another table was sat, a woman and her grown up son. I walked past them and smiled and dropped presets at my table and took some appy plates away. Since the table of 2 was closest to me I greeted them and offered drinks on my way through. I look over and still only dad and baby so I head to the back to drop dishes and grab drinks. Now know that my section today was the furthest section (about 70 feet or so from the server line and the furthest table) so I poured the water and coke for mom/son and grabbed a dip for another table and a preset for another table on my way through. When I enter my section I see that mom is back and dad is still on the phone. I give them a smile, nod to my tray full of things and say I will be right back for them. I dropped the dip off, dropped the drinks and grabbed an order. I went over to the family even though dad was still on the phone. The woman was so pissed. She went off about how they were there first and that the other table better not get their order first. I told her I would obviously put her order in first but couldn't guarantee anything. The woman orders for everyone and I realise that this was not going to go well. Two top has ordered a club (no protein to cook) with fries and fish and chips, that's like 5 minutes but the family has multiple chicken breasts and a big beef burger patty which would be over 12 minutes in cook time alone. I explain that although I would be putting in their order first that the other table might still receive their order first based on the food selected. This was so far from okay for this woman. She demanded that her family receive food first since they arrived first. She went on about how I'm picking and choosing speed of service for people who looked like they tip better. I looked her straight in the face and told her she would need to change her order if she wanted to be sure her food came out first. The only thing I had faster than what they ordered was soup and french fries.

On weekends, we are at max capacity with at least twenty names on the waiting list at all times.  It's rough.  So it's Saturday and the wait to be seated is at least 40 minutes.  This guy who had been waiting walks up to me and frustratingly says ""Can I just get a muffin to go, real quick?""  Which, actually, isn't something I can do ""real quick"" at all.  Not only was I grabbing menus for a table I was about to seat, but then I needed to take their drink order and make their drinks, before going into the cramped kitchen and bugging whoever was on expo to see if they had any muffins to spare.  Then wait for him to check the tickets and make sure we have extra muffins,  and if so, wait for it to be boxed up (I'm not allowed to do it).  Then I have to ring it in, take his payment, and silently murder him with my eyes for taking up so much of my time.

I said I absolutely could do that for him, but would he mind waiting just a minute while I finish seating the next table and making their drinks real quick.  He apparently couldn't wait, and grabbed one of our cookies from the hostess stand that cost $1.50.  They aren't that great, so I let him know and that I'd be just a minute with his much more delicious muffin, if he'd like.  He said ""No, I don't want to wait anymore"" and tossed two dollars down.  I said I'd be right back with his change, but he ignored me and walked out.

A few minutes later, he blows back into the building and slams the half-eaten cookie onto my hostess stand.  ""You were right, that cookie sucked!!""  I sympathized with him and AGAIN offered to get him a muffin.  He angrily said ""No, I want my two dollars back!""  He grabbed his money, started to walk out and yelled ""This SUCKS!""  I yelled back ""YOU suck!""

I'm pretty sure he didn't hear me, but it still felt good.  I'm probably getting fired.   Worth it.

On weekends, we are at max capacity with at least twenty names on the waiting list at all times.  It&amp;#39;s rough.  So it&amp;#39;s Saturday and the wait to be seated is at least 40 minutes.  This guy who had been waiting walks up to me and frustratingly says &amp;quot;Can I just get a muffin to go, real quick?&amp;quot;  Which, actually, isn&amp;#39;t something I can do &amp;quot;real quick&amp;quot; at all.  Not only was I grabbing menus for a table I was about to seat, but then I needed to take their drink order and make their drinks, before going into the cramped kitchen and bugging whoever was on expo to see if they had any muffins to spare.  Then wait for him to check the tickets and make sure we have extra muffins,  and if so, wait for it to be boxed up (I&amp;#39;m not allowed to do it).  Then I have to ring it in, take his payment, and silently murder him with my eyes for taking up so much of my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said I absolutely could do that for him, but would he mind waiting just a minute while I finish seating the next table and making their drinks real quick.  He apparently couldn&amp;#39;t wait, and grabbed one of our cookies from the hostess stand that cost $1.50.

Sorry if this is long, this just happened last night and I’m still a little shocked. 

I am one of the managers at a relatively new, luxury bar in my area. I have been in the industry about 7 years and have seen my fair share of crazies but this just stood out. 

For reference, we are in a single building with another small company separating us from another bar in a pretty rich part of downtown. We frequently get people coming over from the next bar with drinks from there, which is a liability on us so we usually have to ask them to leave.  It’s also not super unusual for people to bring their kids as we have outside seating and serve some small plates, but it usually happens during the day or early evening. 

This one family, first brings a very young boy into the bar (maybe 12 y/o?) and two young girls, one maybe 14-16 and the other MIGHT have been 21 but definitely questionable. They were dancing inside to our live music, which I didn’t feel super comfortable with but they didn’t seem to be a problem and the customers seem to enjoy the young boy as he was dancing around with them. 

That was until my bar manager saw one of the young girls take a sip of a drink and told them they can’t do that and asked them to leave. 
Well it also turns out there was a decent size group of them sitting on our patio with drinks from the bar next door, not ordering anything from their server. I kindly went outside to inform them that this was a liability to the bar and also asked them to leave. They all get up and stand around for a minute while they collect their group, simultaneously, apparently the father goes inside and orders a drink from the bar manager and HANDS IT TO THE 12 YEAR OLD BOY. The boy was about one second away from taking a sip of the drink when the bar manager took all their drinks and asked them to leave, again. 

Then, the two youngest girls walk in with the young boy and mother (? Possibly). I was doing my rounds and happen to be walking behind them when the mother approaches me asking “what’s my problem” and “why am I following  them” to which I responded I’m the manager and was walking around the bar. 

The bar manager who just asked them to leave comes around the bar and again, tells them that they need to leave and one of the young girls basically shoulder checks him and calls him a bitch. So they are still not leaving and my bar manager tells me to call the cops, which I do. After a couple minutes they all leave walking down the sidewalk so I called the cops back and cancelled the call (mistake). 

After a few minutes, I’m standing outside and the hostess is talking to a man and points at me. He then approaches me telling me he needs the name of one of my employees because he “grabbed his sons arm and hurt his shoulder”, which never happened. He demonstrated how he grabbed him on myself to which I asked the man to please not touch me. I proceed to inform him that incident didn’t happen and actually one of the girls in his party got physical with the employee. He then goes on to say he is going to file charges for child abuse and I need to give him the name of said employee and myself, which I don’t, and didn’t. I told him I will speak to the police but not him. He continues to threaten to call the cops and THEN say how we LET his son into the bar. I informed him he was in fact asked to leave several times. 

This whole time this dude is inches from my face, waving his finger in my face and just being an overall douche. He finally tells me I will be hearing from his attorney and tried to take a picture of me, at which point I went inside and they left. 

Maybe next time, get a baby sitter dude.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obligatory “on mobile sorry about formatting”&lt;/p&gt;

Luckily we died down around threeish so my manager started getting people on breaks before we got hit again. 

I’m sat at a table at the back of the restaurant eating my staff food and playing a game on my phone. Enjoying the rest for my feet and back. I’ve been sat there for around 5 minutes when I hear footsteps approaching and look up expecting to see the colleague who was covering my section needing change for a table. 

Instead I see a dude who’d been sat in my section with his girlfriend.

Like every table taken, a queue at the door and a wait on food as the kitchen struggled to keep up. Luckily we died down around threeish so my manager started getting people on breaks before we got hit again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sat at a table at the back of the restaurant eating my staff food and playing a game on my phone. Enjoying the rest for my feet and back. I’ve been sat there for around 5 minutes when I hear footsteps approaching and look up expecting to see the colleague who was covering my section needing change for a table. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead I see a dude who’d been sat in my section with his girlfriend.

 Quick bit of back story: I used to be a delivery driver for a large pizza food chain for about 4 years. I've got stories galore of great customers and terrible. This one however is my go to story.

Yall ever seen the porno scits where it's a pizza delivery guy and some chic trying get action. If so, then you've got a good understanding of what happened to me this day. It was football season, and our team was having a home game. Which means we were busy as high hell. I was doing deliveries with 3 or more orders in one shot. And towards the end of my shift, about 10 o'clock, I was tasked with one last delivery. My manager asked for me to take it before I went, and I held high respect for him so of course I took it. He gave me warning before I stepped out that the delivery I was being given might be a bit drunk. Oh, yay, gotta love it.

Took me about 5 minutes to get to the address, and the house is fairly nice. Nothing extravagant, but modest. I got up to the door and knock slightly lighter then how a cop might do. As I have with every house I've delivered to. Afterwards I waited about 2 minutes before repeating the process. But, halfway through me knocking the door swings open quickly and what stands before me is a woman I'd say, from the unfortunate quick glance I got, to be around mid 60's. Wearing nothing but a dark purple loose mesh dress. I quickly averted my gaze to the ceiling behind her so that only her face was in my field of view. I was too shocked to give my normal greeting and price speil. And she just stood leaning on the doorway trying to look as... ""seductive"" if you want to call it that... As she could. She broke the momentary silence with that God awful phrase you hear in every pizza guy porn of, ""Did you make sure to bring extra sausage for me."" and she finished with a lick of the lips. In the moment, not only did I realize her intentions. But, I felt myself die inside and my soul noped out of my body running to whatever safe haven it could find. I eventually stuttered her price to her, in which she pulled the money from God knows where and took her pizza. I immediately turned on my heels with enough force I think I left a burn mark on her front mat and speed walked to my car. I never looked back at the house in fear of what may be greedily staring me down, and just hoped into my car. I took off slowly as to look like nothing was wrong. But, the moment I felt I was out of sight I slammed the pedal down. Made it back to the store in 2 minutes flat. My manage saw my still pale face and asked what happened. After I told him he about fell to the floor laughing. I just walked to the back, washed my hands and put some gloves on to pull the money she gave out to put into the till. And while counting it I realized she didn't tip at all. So to the old lady the tried to reanact a porn, I admire your willingness in age. But for all that is holy please spare us the therapy required for that unholy vision.

We do online deliveries and the company we pay to handle it is called Yoyo. They work pretty much the same as Just Eat and Deliveroo (different to Deliveroo in that they use a 3rd company for the delivery and courier - same couriers as Just Eat) in that they handle the orders and assign riders and deal with customers.

We'd been having issues with this company as things would go wrong often (no rider assigned and no rider available, cancelled orders, etc) so this was the last straw.

A customer placed an order at 5pm to be delivered for 8pm. All fine. It comes to 10 past 8 and we have no rider. I call Yoyo for the 3rd time and ask them is there a rider and they say no rider has been assigned and they'll ask the courier company to prioritise it. 5 minutes pass. The kitchen closes at 8.30pm and we already threw one batch of the food out. I call Yoyo as per my chef's instructions and say if they can't get a rider here before 8.30pm then they will have to cancel the order and if they do so please could they call the customer and explain the situation.

Not 5 minutes later I get a call from the customer. Immediately I can tell he is looking to have a go at someone -no doubt hangry and pissed off.

After he said he placed an order earlier I said ah yes, I know you. I then explained the shit show Yoyo and the couriers and I said it isn't our fault as we made the food fine and can still make it but as no rider has been assigned and one won't be assigned in time there's nothing I can do. I said I'm so sorry about this and this issue will be taken higher as it's unacceptable.

He started raising his voice and saying it is our fault and we should control these things. I said I understand you're annoyed and I do empathise but you will get a full refund and I'm really sorry. 

Things...did not improve...he started shouting and shouting saying it is my fault saying we are a shit company saying we need to sort this out right now and get him his food...

At this point I knew he was just looking to shout and argue and use me as a verbal punchbag. I had an extremely long day and wasn't prepared to talk to someone being so irrational and aggressive. So I hung up.

He called back 10 seconds later and ask to speak to my manager. I happily passed it over. My manager had a 10 minute conversation which included him constantly interrupting her and shouting at her and telling her we're a useless company with a useless business model and kept demanding answers even though we'd explained things. My manager ended up shouting over him saying ""SIR I CANNOT ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS IF YOU KEEP INTERRUPTING ME"" and after that he backed down a little. In the end he still wasn't happy and he called for me to be fired - he was adamant that I simply told him ""it isn't my problem"" and hung up. 

I'm not proud if hanging up - usually I'd bear through it and just get the conversation to end. However I was just not willing to allow someone to speak to me like that - it's not my job. I understand things got fucked up but if you start shouting at me I'm not going to be so receptive. 

If he'd have been just a fraction calmer and not treated me as a verbal punchbag I would have happily arrange a free meal in the future and a continued 10% discount.

But if you start speaking to me like that? No, sorry.

Thankfully my manager said she doesn't blame and she would've done the same. She also said she doesn't believe him regarding what he said about me but she checked the voice recording on CCTV just to say she checked it if he got back in touch.

So last night (Friday), this older (late 60s) couple come in. It’s 8, and my dining room is full. They come in at the same time as 3 other groups and a phone call comes in. So I hang up the phone, smile at the wife and ask what I can do for her. 
She’s pleasant, doesn’t smile, but doesn’t give me issue when I tell her it’ll be ~20 minutes. Her husband is hunched over, going about 2 steps per minute, and I never talk to him. 
Then I take care of the other groups who came in who all had reservations and seat them right away. The manager comes over and asks if the couple chose to eat in the bar, where we only have high tops. I say no, but I’m on a wait. Manager looks at computer screen and a table left and was cleaned without my knowledge. So we can seat the couple right away at a table that is close to the front and convenient to get to if you have a walker/walking problems. 
Manager seats them. 
Time goes by, I get all my closing jobs done. 9:05, I see the couple getting up and it takes the guy a while to get out of his seat. 
When it’s not busy at the host stand, I bring my kindle to pass the time. It’s never caused me to not do my job and both managers are aware that I’m up there reading. And when it’s busy, the kindle is in my pocket the whole time. 
The woman walks ahead of her husband and grabs a toothpick from my stand and I thank her for coming in. Again, she’s pleasant but not smiling, like before. The guy finally gets up to the host stand and I smile and thank him. Without looking at me, he says, “Maybe if you didn’t have your nose in your iPad all night, you’d get more compliments and tips.” 
I had no idea where this came from. I just thanked him for coming in again. There’s also, no tip jar or obligation/recommendation to tip the host. 
His wife walks ahead and holds the door open for him while he walks across a rug. She says, “Watch out for the rug.” And he loudly says, “Maybe if someone got up to help me, it wouldn’t be an issue.” I didn’t because I wasn’t about to help someone who said such mean shit to me. 
I’m wracking my brain to figure out where his rude comment came from since that was the first and only time I talked to him. 
I asked both the server and manager if this table made any complaints about me, and both said no. 
I just need some reassurance that I’m not the only one to get, what feels like, unsolicited horrible feedback, because this incident is really throwing me for a loop.

I have never had a problem arise between us, he just acts strangely towards me. When somebody like this is a regular, I come to work prepared to do my best for the guy (greet him pleasantly and make small talk, try to have his usual drink ready for him ahead of time, basically whatever I can do to show him I’m here to do a good job for him). 

So it’s the last night of his season. I had been serving him weekly for 6 months. In other words, he ought to have noticed a little something about my work ethic. So he is closing out his final tab of the season and pays me in cash. I am chatting with him a little about his summer plans and mistakenly I gave him the wrong change- one dollar less than it should have been. He counts his change says “this is wrong, you only gave me X when it should have been Y”. He was right, I did, oops. Immediately I’m reopening my drawer telling him “I’m so sorry about that” and give him his dollar. He looks me dead in the eye and says “you weren’t trying to get a bigger tip, were you?” He was so blunt that I actually thought he was joking at first so I laugh and say “of course not!” when I realize that he is actually very serious indeed, and he’s just... staring me down.

Offended and usure what else to say, I just kind of quietly and firmly said “I would never”. With that, he takes his change and walks away without a word, leaving no tip, not to be seen again until the fall. 

That really burned me up. This guy always gave me an attitude for no reason that I could ever figure. I never gave him wrong change before and I am always friendly with him, trying to provide him good service. It’s so aggravating that he would accuse me of trying to rip him off for a bigger tip. Why would I risk my job for one dollar? Not to mention, I had put the dollar in question IN THE REGISTER, it wasn’t as if I gave him the wrong change and had kept it sitting in front of me on the counter and was trying to be sneaky.

So this probably seems like not so big of a deal but like it grosses me out!

We have a manager in training he's not going to be in our location but one close by. Don't ask why he's training in my location cus idk. Anyways so I have my first shift with him on and to start with he looks a lil unsure but fair enough he's new to this and I don't think he was a server before so it makes sense. HOWEVER... before you can be in FOH/BOH you have to complete all these online training courses and stuff so you know what to do. So he should know how everything works if he read over everything and something that even if I was skimming over stuff I would read would be the cleaning instructions and health and safety things cus they're important. So either he missed the memo or... Because when we clean the tables we're meant to spray the ""sanitiser"" (cleaning spray) then wipe it with a blue cloth. Now we are told to leave the cleaning spray on the table for 30 seconds before wiping and I will admit I don't do this unless there are a lot of tables needing cleaned at once and  I'll go spray all of them go back to the start and wipe all of them so it sits for 30 seconds but for  table I just spray wait a few seconds and wipe the chairs/booth then the table.

BUT THIS GUY just goes right to the table with ONLY the flippin cloth and wipes. Now sure the cloth might have a lil bit of cleaning spray on it but DEFINITELY not enough to properly clean the table. I even hinted that you're meant to use the spray by picking one up going over to him and saying ""do you need the spray?"" and he said no... DUDE I'm tryna help you out here! Now I don't want to just say to him ""by the way we're meant to spray the tables before we use the cloth"" because we we're told to treat him like a manager and I 10/10 wouldn't tell my manager what to do. So I was gonna tell the actual manager/assistant manager what was happening because he's not really properly cleaning the table and if I was a customer and saw him clean like that I wouldn't want to sit at that table. It's not like he hasn't seen me and my coworkers cleaning either so he sees us ALL using the spray yet doesn't use it???

Also this guy gives me weird vibes but like idk. He seems alright but I do think that to be a manager you should've had to of at least worked at a - insert pizza places name here - before because then you'd know the basics. It's also not like they're not told to do that because when I was shown how to set tables I was shown by the assistant manager (who had only worked here for about 3/4 months and hadn't worked here before) and she's the one who said about the whole 30 second thing and how no one really does it but if you have time to then try to leave it for 30 seconds and she told me to use the spray!!!!!! So there's no way in heck this guy hasn't been told to do that!

Just venting/fishing for advice. Sorry in advance if it gets long.


I started a new job at a restaurant a little over a month ago. This is my first time in the business, though I do customer service at my other job and have worked w/ food before. (And, technically, I'm a hostess. But I also bus tables and am /supposed/ to be taking phone and to-go orders. More later. Hopefully that's close enough for this sub.)


So far, the job's mostly fine. All my coworkers are great, super helpful, and seem like they appreciate having me around. I like working with them! But due to a few things my body has slowly started telling me ""this sucks, actually"" and ""you're starting to wear yourself out."" I only work two dinner shifts a week, but they're Fri/Sat, which are ofc our busiest days and they kind of ruin half my weekend. I spend a lot of time stressing out before getting to work or decompressing after. I'd ask about changing my schedule, but it's not like I've been there that long. Maybe I just need more time to get used to it.


However, I think the biggest problem is our boss/the owner… all of the staff complains about her. The host that was training me and a former one who stopped by for his last check both said ""good luck dealing with her."" I tried to do what a lot of people say, to disregard their opinions and try to form my own, but so far a lot of their complaints seem pretty solid.


At first they all made fun of her thick accent, which I do think is unnecessary and mean, but I'd be lying if I said I don't struggle to understand her sometimes. She mostly seems in over her head. She is constantly stressed/rushed and trying to find shortcuts. I've mentioned to her a few times that I still haven't been trained to take orders, but she always says ""we're too busy."" She expects me to answer phones and tell people to hold until I can get someone else to enter the order into the POS for me. My manager, who's been there for 20 years, has a much better grasp on how the resteraunt works and the owner constantly has to call her or ask her for help on her days off. (Note: She's been the owner for 6 years. The manager and all the experienced staff say she hasn't improved much in that time.)


Most concerning, I had a server pull me aside the other day and tell me ""If you catch her trying to give your tip to the kitchen, bring it up with her. But be careful, she fired the last guy who fought with her about it."" She also didn't give me my W-4 to sign or my paychecks until a month in. (I know. My other job covered it, and at least I eventually got my money.) Something about them switching to a direct deposit system at the same time as I was hired on, and she had to figure all that out first. Like I said! I don't really know what she meant, she's hard to understand. To be fair, she tried to explain it to me ahead of time, and because I already make enough to cover rent, I just said ""sure.""


So! TLDR: A little bummed about my schedule, /mostly/ bummed about the (inexperienced??? For six years?) owner. I'm new to the restaurant scene, but everyone tells me I should start looking for work somewhere else… I think it'd at least be a good idea to show a little backbone and try to stick with it as long as I can, especially for my first job.

When I worked at a local deli, there was this one lady. Didn’t come in often enough to be considered even a semi-regular.  But her order was notorious. The woman always ordered just one sandwich for herself. Sounds simple, but she ordered it with so many modifications that the order would take up almost an entire ticket and rack up a lot of extra costs. No allergies or special diet. She was just “a bit specific”. Example: If we didn’t cut her sandwich perfectly into fourths? She needs a refund and we are incompetent. If we sold out of the only type of bread she liked? Day ruined. 

When she would come in, she would ask me to repeat her order back to her. She always seemed slightly upset that I never messed it up. Then she would lean over the counter and stare at the employees while they made her sandwich, occasionally barking at them to do this or not do that. She never tipped and always acted like she was in a huge hurry. 

One afternoon, I took her order and she left with no complaints. Thanks god. My manager noted that the the woman had gotten increasingly worse with her pickiness over time and would have a meltdown if her requests were not executed to her exact likings, so I made sure to double check her order. 

But a bit later, she comes barging back in with 30 minutes until close. She instantly demands a refund AND that we make her a new sandwich free of charge. We apparently used deli mustard on her sandwich instead of yellow mustard. The deli mustard “ruined her entire day”, and she had to specifically have OUR yellow mustard (nothing special, not made in house, probably from a Costco).

I apologize, although it’s a bit odd. I swore I checked the order, and she watched us make it. She initially blamed me, so I found her order ticket and read it out loud. It said yellow mustard. Phew. She asks to see the ticket because she doesn’t believe me, so I show her. Upon seeing that I was correct, she then proceeds to blame the kitchen and again demands a refund along with a new sandwich. Basically she wanted $18 worth of food free of charge. 

The deli policy states that we can usually only refund or remake orders if the customer shows proof of purchase and brings in their old order if possible to confirm. In the past, customers would occasionally try to scam us for free food, so the rule ensured that we wouldn’t get taken advantage of. There were a few exceptions, but she didn’t qualify. 

I tell her the policy, but that apparently won’t work for her. I ask her kindly if she could bring back the order. She says no, that it wouldn’t be necessary. She is now talking to me slowly like I am unable to understand her, and she is beginning to act hostile. My manager decides to help out. This woman tries to haggle with us to strike up some sort of deal. We aren’t buying it. The manager asks her what happened to the old order, and after dancing around that question for a bit, she lets us know that it was eaten. She finally admits to eating the whole thing but assured us that she had absolutely no choice in the matter because she was ‘just so hungry’ and ‘starving’. Starving for entitlement maybe, but that’s about it. 

We were now locking the doors in 20 minutes, and this woman is whining about mustard. Cue tiny violin. And for all we knew, she could have been lying to us for a free sandwich. It wouldn’t be unlikely. She eventually left empty handed despite my manager throwing in a nice discount to get her to shut up if we made her another sandwich. It was summer, so I offered her a free drink on the way out to stay cool in the heat.

It was not practical for my business to go against policy and hand out almost $20 worth of free food in most scenarios. If we were extremely generous to every customer that acted entitled, we would lose money. If her sandwich was that bad, she should not have eaten the whole thing and would not have avoided telling us that the sandwich had already been digested. She was rude, and we were fed up with her previous requests as well. We are a family-owned, local establishment that prides itself on honesty, loyalty, and respect. Customers are expected to follow that as well. 

She refused to accept the free drink, a bold protest towards the condiment and business that ruined her entire day. How brave of her.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s jump right into it. &lt;/p&gt;

Foodrunner, not a server, but it's close enough in the context of this story. 



So I've been a foodrunner at a well-known Asian chain restaurant for about three months now. My tray-carying skills are still a little shabby but I hadn't dropped a tray with actual food on it until now. 

At our restaurant, when a customer orders soup it is usually the runner's job to pour it into the cup or the bowl from the well and (obviously) run it out if the server isn't around. Now, like most soups that are freshly poured, they're hot as f**k when they first come out, and spilling some on your body can hurt like hell (burned the f**k out of my hand on my first day of training). 

So I'm chugging through a busy lunch shift and I get an order for a wonton soup bowl on my screen. Our soup bowls are meant to feed multiple people so they're not necessarily small (probably the size of a bowl of pho for comparison). Since they are meant for multiple people they come with smaller soup cups for each person at the table to serve themselves. By the time the bowl is all ready to go the server for the table it's meant for doesn't appear to be around, so I tray it up and start taking it out. However, like I said before, I'm not the most experienced tray carrier. So despite it fitting on the smaller circular trays, I use a big tray and grab a tray jack so that I can pass out the bowl and the cups more safely once I'm at the table. This of course means that I have the tray on my shoulder as it is kinda heavy and I'm not strong enough right now to carry it any other way. 

I arrive at the table from behind to two guests (older man and woman) who are sitting on adjacent sides (square 4 top) so I must walk around them to the open side to begin the much anticipated soup distribution. As I'm turning to face them I make the mistake of verbally confirming with them that this is indeed their wonton soup, causing my concentration to shift from my tray to the customers. I lost balance and the bowl began to slide off of its serving plate and towards the now-tilted edge of the tray. I reacted as best I could and used my other hand, that had thankfully just finished setting up the tray jack, to stop it from falling. The cups however were not so lucky and fell to the floor, breaking into a few pieces. Unfortunately, I was not able to stop the bowl from spilling and slightly splashing the pant leg of the man. As well as absolutely drenching my arm in the hot soup. 

Immediately, a server who was bussing a nearby table came to help me set the tray down and deal with the customers who just saw their hopes and dreams of overpriced soup heaven splatter all over some stupid boy's scrawny arm. My manager also happened to be close by and immediately told me to go and take care of my arm in the back. As this is all happening, the man who's pants were given an unexpected refreshment starts laughing to himself in a somewhat sarcastic and slightly maniacal way. I noped out of there instantly. 

The lady demanded that they're food be remade because I had ""dropped a glass"" and the other food that had been on the table was now most definitely covered in the shards of the tiny ass cups that had broken upon impact with the GROUND. They then asked for the remake to be made to-go and left as soon as possible, leaving what I'm assuming was a shitty tip. 

Once I was in the kitchen I wrapped my hand in a wet towel for a minute and then did what I figured was the only thing I could do, put my head down and get back to work. Everyone that had seen what had happened asked if I was okay and I just said yes so that we wouldn't spend longer on the issue than we needed to. I honestly did end up feeling fine later as my hands have been getting used to hot soup and plates over the last few months, but it still stung pretty bad for a few minutes (especially when I grabbed plates from under the heat lamp).

While the ""victims"" of this whole incident didn't seem to consider the fact that a nineteen year-old boy just burned his goddamn arm to save their khakis from a wonton tsunami. The servers of the surrounding tables told me that their customers were repeatedly asking them if I was fine. I even had one table ask to speak to me themselves to make sure that I was okay and to help cheer me up. 

The absolute kicker of this story came when I was talking to the table's actual server later in the day. She said that she asked the man if he was okay when she rushed over to help clean up the mess

I hope this is the right spot for this.

So I've been in this industry for 17 years.  Mostly serving, however a few years of bartending.  For the past ten years it's been my dream to own my own bed and breakfast.  However, over the past year (and especially tonight) I honestly don't think I want to do this shit anymore.  

From February to September I took seven months off because I was losing my passion for this industry.   Honestly, it was the most stress free period of my entire life.  I ended up Ubering to bring in a little income here and there and worked on my own time.  It was fucking fantastic.  I knew that being an Uber driver wasn't smart on my vehicle and thought that seven months was ample enough time for me to be ready to get back into the service industry.  Well, I was fucking wrong.

So last month, my lease came up and I moved up to, upstate NY from, SC because they actually pay servers up here.  I went from making $2.13 an hour to almost $11.20 an hour.  I did a lot of research to find the job that I thought would ultimately fit me - and I landed that job with very little trouble.  I was just waiting to see what the ""catch"" was.  Well, I found it.

What I didn't realize in, NY state is that you can't work more than six hours at a time without taking a break or they have to pay you more per hour.  This doesn't work well when you're a fucking server.  You can be on a second course of a meal and a manager will take over your tables and send you on break.  I don't like that at all.  It sets a weird vibe at the table when you have to explain to them that someone else is taking over because you have to take a break.  I NEVER make a decent tip when someone takes over my service - and it always seems to happen to me when I'm at my buisest part of the night.

The restaurant I work for is attached to a hotel, and it's a very upper class kind of establishment with average checks are between $100-$500.  We have SA's that we have to tip out 3% of our entire sales and 1% tip out for bartenders - so I tip out 4% of my sales every night.  I never tip out less than $40 a night and average between $250-$300 in tip outs weekly - so over $1000 a month.  That's fucking insane to pay someone so much to polish silverware, bus tables (which I 90% do myself anyway) and polish glasses.  Fucking. Insane.

So here's the kicker.  I waited on a table of eight tonight and their bill was at $557 - all separate checks.  I went to my manager, because surely they add gratuity to larger parties to back up their employees financially - especially when this party is taking up 3/4 of my section for two hours.  Well I was wrong.  He gave me some fucking bullshit lie that it's a, NY state law that they can't add gratuity to a party.  I know this is a lie because I literally looked it up before moving here and I have friends here that have worked in this city for over ten years.  I'm not one of those fucking stupid servers.  I looked at him and said: ""That's the most insane thing I have ever heard and I wouldn't have taken this job had I known that.""
His response was: ""I'm sorry, it's company policy"".

NY state policy or COMPANY policy?!?!  Red flag.

So I let it go and had faith in my customers (no, I really didn't) and dropped the check.  I shit you not, all eight of them tipped me a total of 12 fucking dollars.  It cost me $18 dollars to wait on them.  I completely lost my shit and shut down completely.  

Out of $1500 dollars in sales, I left with $128.  That has never happened to me in my entire life.  I don't give people bad service.  This is my livelihood.  I take it super seriously.   I'm just so frustrated that my employer can essentially ""grat me"" to pay SA's, but I can't grat people to ensure my income - especially on a bill that fucking high.

Oh, and he completely comped an entire tables meal with a $120 tab because they thought people were being rude to them and they didn't even fucking tip me.

Im just so frustrated that I can't even wrap my head around this situation - or even get on board with my employer from this point on.  I've already decided to quit, but I'm going to work another month to stack some money and just move back down south.  I, however, will not put any energy from here on out into this job.  I'm just more frustrated in myself for not getting these details before accepting the job.

I don't think I want to work in this industry anymore after I finish this job.  Am I in the wrong here?  Am I not being humble enough?  I walk into this place with 100% positivity and leave there, normally, with a very bad outlook because they have some fucked up procedures in the way they run their restaurant.

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant I work for is attached to a hotel, and it&amp;#39;s a very upper class kind of establishment with average checks are between $100-$500.  We have SA&amp;#39;s that we have to tip out 3% of our entire sales and 1% tip out for bartenders - so I tip out 4% of my sales every night.  I never tip out less than $40 a night and average between $250-$300 in tip outs weekly - so over $1000 a month.  That&amp;#39;s fucking insane to pay someone so much to polish silverware, bus tables (which I 90% do myself anyway) and polish glasses.  Fucking. Insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the kicker.  I waited on a table of eight tonight and their bill was at $557 - all separate checks.  I went to my manager, because surely they add gratuity to larger parties to back up their employees financially - especially when this party is taking up 3/4 of my section for two hours.  Well I was wrong.  He gave me some fucking bullshit lie that it&amp;#39;s a, NY state law that they can&amp;#39;t add gratuity to a party.  I know this is a lie because I literally looked it up before moving here and I have friends here that have worked in this city for over ten years.  I&amp;#39;m not one of those fucking stupid servers.  I looked at him and said: &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s the most insane thing I have ever heard and I wouldn&amp;#39;t have taken this job had I known that.&amp;quot;
His response was: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, it&amp;#39;s company policy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NY state policy or COMPANY policy?!?!  Red flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I let it go and had faith in my customers (no, I really didn&amp;#39;t) and dropped the check.  I shit you not, all eight of them tipped me a total of 12 fucking dollars.  It cost me $18 dollars to wait on them.  I completely lost my shit and shut down completely.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of $1500 dollars in sales, I left with $128.  That has never happened to me in my entire life.  I don&amp;#39;t give people bad service.  This is my livelihood.  I take it super seriously.   I&amp;#39;m just so frustrated that my employer can essentially &amp;quot;grat me&amp;quot; to pay SA&amp;#39;s, but I can&amp;#39;t grat people to ensure my income - especially on a bill that fucking high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and he completely comped an entire tables meal with a $120 tab because they thought people were being rude to them and they didn&amp;#39;t even fucking tip me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im just so frustrated that I can&amp;#39;t even wrap my head around this situation - or even get on board with my employer from this point on.  I&amp;#39;ve already decided to quit, but I&amp;#39;m going to work another month to stack some money and just move back down south.  I, however, will not put any energy from here on out into this job.  I&amp;#39;m just more frustrated in myself for not getting these details before accepting the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I want to work in this industry anymore after I finish this job.  Am I in the wrong here?  Am I not being humble enough?  I walk into this place with 100% positivity and leave there, normally, with a very bad outlook because they have some fucked up procedures in the way they run their restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I digress.  Thanks for letting me rant.  I really needed to get that out.&lt;/p&gt;

So when I was 18 I moved to Canada all by myself and my English wasn't great.

I got a job in this fancy Russian restaurant where most of the customers spoke Russian. The owner didn't speak English and I didn't speak Russian but could understand some. I don't even know why anyone hired me but I appreciate the fuck out of them for it to this day. Bless their hearts. 

It was a table during my first week there and that place was fancy in the front but super scummy in the back so everything was frozen and microwaved. This couple ordered some soup for starters, it was kinda hard for me to get their order since they only spoke English and most of the menu was Russian but I got it and brought out their order, few minutes later they waved me up and complained that the soup is not hot enough, I was like oh shit... (This is an uzbeki style soup and suppose to be spicccyy) I took it to the back and told the owner that the soup is not spicy enough and she was kinda offended because in her mind she made it spicy so she just dumps a whole bunch of red chili flakes in and tells me to take it back.

Guys. It’s infuriating. This server refuses to let anyone help them, won’t ask for help, will tell you no when you offer to help, and then will be heard bitching about how nobody helps them. They fuck up orders constantly, so the guests are coming to the host’s stand to complain and you’ll end up serving their table half the time. They don’t bus tables, so during a busy shift you’ll be running back and forth between the hotel desk, the host’s stand, the phone, the kitchen, the tables of guests who won’t let this server serve them anymore, and about five thousand other places. They fuck up checks so you of course have to try to fix it or go find the manager. Guests will of course get pissed at you because they haven’t eaten yet and they’ve been here an hour, or guests will get mad because they haven’t been seated yet- because you fucking can’t seat them because none of the other guests can leave yet. Manager gets pissed off because you have guests waiting at the host’s stand while you’re fucking babysitting. All in all, YOU look bad because of someone else!

And where should you draw the line? 

I occasionally serve at this restaurant, but I’m also cross-trained for a few positions. I was working a host shift one night because our host position is cursed (another story). I stick to the host stand if needed, but wow, I feel so useless just standing there when no one is coming in after a rush. Usually I’ll keep an eye on the door while making rounds to bus and run drinks. I’m taking dishes to the dish pit when I hear it. 

“Hello, um excuse me!”

I stop and turn around.

“Over here! Waiter, I need service NOW!” 

Oh my god. 

I’m that stubbornly lazy person that refuses to make two trips to the car to get the groceries so instead I struggle to carry them all in at once. I apply a similar approach to bussing. Anyways, me and my stack of dishes look over to see an eight top of individuals who sort of look like actual adults, but if they told you they were 17, you wouldn’t fight them on it. 

One girl looks timid. Immediately, she blurts out that she told her friend to not complain. Her sympathy tells me that she has probably worked in a similar position before. It also forewarns me that her friend is probably a Karen in training. Not bad enough to earn the independent title, but she’s up and coming. 

The mini Karen loudly interrupts her friend and immediately starts to complain to me, disregarding my busyness and piles of dishes. I tell her that I’ll put the dishes away and come back to give her my full attention. She huffs, looks agitated, but says nothing.

So I come back. I’m told she didn’t like her order of food. The table just finished their meal and most of the plates are empty, so I’m a bit confused. Usually a customer would bring up a complaint shortly after being served. When I ask what she ordered, she acts annoyed that I do not have the omniscience to know that she ordered mac n cheese. The mac n cheese is a popular favorite and also is a large portion. So she ate most of it, or at least someone did.

But she hated it, she says. She tells me she watched all of her friends eat their delicious food while she was punished with her terrible order of mac n cheese.

The table had been there for almost three hours, and their server is known for being accommodating and wonderful with service. He definitely would have asked if everyone enjoyed their food shortly after they got it. I don’t argue with her. I kindly apologize, and ask if there’s anything I can do to make her experience better. 

She immediately knows what she needs to make up for this.

“I’m not paying for this.”

She locks eyes with me. Her eyes are dully devoid of any positive human emotion. 

I tell her that I’ll ask a manager to see what I can do. I ask what was specifically wrong with the dish, pointing out that most of it was eaten already. I was simply curious because our chefs take critique very seriously, and I wanted to make sure that we didn’t seriously mess up. 

“I shouldn’t have to pay for this.”

She never explained specifically what was wrong, just that it was all wrong. I’ve never heard so many variations of the word ‘bad’ come out of someone’s mouth without them actually being able to describe what the problem was. 

When I find the manager, I can tell that she has run out of patience for the night. I explain the situation with the mac n cheese that mini Karen ate, and she just comps the meal and gives their whole table a discount without even leaving her office. She seems annoyed by the table’s request, but she doesn’t fight it. 

I go back and let them know about the discount. The first girl I mentioned, the embarrassed one, still looks embarrassed but thanks me profusely. Mini Karen, well...she looks thrilled. Immediately, her night isn’t ruined. As I walk towards the host stand, I can hear her boasting to the rest of the table that she got them a discount AND gotten her own meal for free. What a deal!

I’ve had customers complain about their food orders before. Some are apologetic and timid. Many of them order something else and move on. Some customers suck it up and finish their meal anyways while assuring me that it’s okay. They don’t expect discounts even if they are offered, and they simply order something else next time. 

At a previous establishment I worked for, the owner actually refused to do refunds on some to-go orders if the customer had eaten all of their food before complaining or failed to bring in their messed-up order. This was because so many people in the past had tried to cheat the system to get extra food and to avoid paying. 

So.... were we too kind to mini Karen? 

If you don’t like your food, it’s best to speak up immediately. Mistakes happen. Sometimes the food just sucks. But we’ll take care of it. The way mini Karen demanded to get her already eaten meal for free without mentioning what was actually wrong raises a red flag. And conveniently, she complained right before paying and looked smugly satisfied upon letting her group know she scored them a discount, more red flags. Her attitude? You guessed it, red flag. 


Do customers sometimes lie and scheme to get discounts at your restaurant? How do you handle it? When should you give in, and when should you let them have their way?

[TLDR] at the bottom.

This happened yesterday and honestly just need to let it out to move on. I am the MOD (manager on duty) when the owner isn't around and tonight I had to take a call from a very ""inconvenienced"" customer. 

She starts by saying she has been coming to the restaurant for a long time and has ordered the same food for years so that makes her an expert on our food and how its served.... She says her salad was absolutely horrible because it had broccoli and beans in it and according to her, our salads have ""never ever EVER"" came with broccoli or beans. I let her angerly tell me her life story related to the restaurant and how this ruined her meal and evening. Then in my very calm, polite customer service voice I explained that we have always made our salads with broccoli and beans (it's an antipasto salad) and that I'm sorry she didnt like it, she is welcome to come back and have it remade without said items. That wasn't good enough as I'd was asking her to waste her gas on our mistake. I let her know I can't refund her because that's how our salad is made and of course she is not happy. She pushes that she knows better than me since shes been coming here for years and the salads DO NOT have b&amp;bs and that I have no idea what I'm talking about... She told me to google it...? 

We go back and forth with this for a while until she moves on to another complaint.  She says she asked ""specifically asked for red italian dressing....RED dressing, Ra- eh- dauh!""... We have one type of italian so at this point I think she has us mixed up with another location. I wait until she pauses and, again, very politely say ""I'm sorry ma'am, but we only have one kind of italian dressing here, are you sure you're calling the right location?""... 

This sends her off and she starts saying I'm calling her stupid and being so rude to her. She then slowly and condescendingly names the streets the restaurant is on. She wants to speak to someone who knows what they are talking about and says that she is sick of my tone and attitude... I had been saying sorry over and over and been as polite as possible the whole entire time, but okay sure 

 She wants corporate number (we are family owned) , my name, the owner's information, the whole nine yards. I explain we aren't corporate owed and I cant give out the owners information. But my name is Altruismisyourfriend and I'm sorry I haven't been able to resolve the issue.

She continues, now saying my customer service skills are horrible and I need to be retrained because I have a tone and I'm not LISTENING TO HER! She is the customer! She is unhappy and she deserves a refund NOW! 

After about 10 minutes of her repeating her complaints and her insults, I see the owner comes in and I decide to hand the call over. I am for the most part numb to calls like that, but this made my blood boil. To think there are people like her out there that would try to get someone fired over broccoli and beans in their salad, is a blow to my faith in humanity.  

So I briefed the owner on her issue and let him know I offered to remake it for her, but not refund her since we technically did nothing wrong. (We've had multiple meetings about being more strict with complaints demanding refunds because we have a problem with people abusing our policy)... so he takes the call and I walk away. Now, I wasn't worried about my job at all, I was worried that the owner would give in and make me look like an idiot...... And that's exactly what happened. I should have, as the owner explained after he got off the phone,  ""belittled myself and given her what she wanted because she will be back to spend money anyway and that's how we win in the long run""... great! 

I get it. I totally understand the concept of retaining customers, even the ones that are shitty, but you can be professional, polite, and accommodating without belittling yourself or your employees. I wish that wasn't such a novel concept. 

I hope she is happy with her refund and superiority complex.

I feel better now.

Long time lurker, first time poster. Also on mobile. 

This happened a couple of years back, but I thought it might be enjoyed here. I work at a small pizza restaurant in the middle of flyover country. This guy calls in and wants to make an order for an extra large pizza. Thinking nothing of our, I give the ticket to the kitchen and they make it. The drama started when he came in to pick it up. 

Apparently the last time this guy ordered, he got a large pizza, came in to pick it up, paid for it and left. Shortly after that, we get a call from him claiming a topping was missing. “Not a big problem,” I thought. This happens every once in a while. At the time, the policy was to give customers a discount on their next order, so I told him I could give him a free topping the next time he got a large pizza or smaller. He said this was fine and I thought nothing of it. 

Fast forward to the present and he just arrived to pick up his extra large pizza. He walks in and gives one of the other workers his name and they grab his order. When they go to cash him out, he says, “No, this pizza is on the house, last time I was here a topping was left off of my pizza.” The employee that was ringing him out told him that the only discount he has on file is a free topping on a large pizza. Obviously, the customer didn’t like hearing this. We don’t have a manager on duty, so we called the owner and had him verify that it was being rung up correctly. 

The customer then started yelling about how the business was one of the worst restaurants he had ever been to and proceeded to throw the pizza box on the floor and Storm out of the building saying he would never step foot in there again. 

Luckily, we only had one table at that point and it was a group of friends of one of the other employees. They all had a good laugh about it. The policy now is that we will offer to remake the pizza if they find anything wrong with it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all! Long time lurker, first time poster.

When we first opened we had the latest liquor license (1 am) for like 15 blocks and our kitchen stayed open until close. We built up a following of neighbors and industry people, it was great. New manager decides to bend to laziness and launches a late-night menu so the cooks can get out faster at the end of the night. No thought is put into the menu, customers hate it. Even though there is no food in the immediate area after 11 pm, People start eating before they come in or leaving early to hit up a McDs. Food sales down. 

New New Manager decides the kitchen costs too much to keep open late for so few dishes as we sell mostly drinks. Our business takes a hit because even if industry people didn't eat much they still want food after work. We lost that crowd and late nights were slower. 

New New New manager realizes our liquor license says we have to serve food as long as we're serving drinks. The kitchen reopens late-night. But they don't tell anyone, like not even a facebook post. So we don't get a lot of people eating.

New New New New manager tries to get more late-night crowd and decides we should try to compete with the chain restaurant nearby (who closes an hour or two before us) and offer ""late-night happy hour"" certain drinks and food are $5. Again no promotion, so now we have the same few people coming in but instead of $9 beer and $10 appies, they're buying $5 beer and $5 appies. So now this manager decides that since revenue is low at night we're changing our hours to close much earlier. 

It's like a comedy of fucking errors and I'm sitting here like maybe you should use the blessing of the late liquor license (which is really really hard to get where I live and if we start closing earlier we'll never get to be open those late hours again) and promote that we serve drinks and food later than any place in like 15-20 blocks when there are restaurants that all close earlier than us nearby and a residential neighborhood. Maybe the locals and industry people would come back if they knew we were serving food again. Maybe revenue is too low to stay open now not because not enough people are coming in, but because everything costs 5 fucking dollars. I 've seen this bullshit before, cutting hours without thinking and lack of promotion is how places go out of business.  &lt;EndRant&gt;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my work has been through managers like kleenex. One sets a policy and the new ones change it. Whatever I try to keep my head down and make my money. Yes boss, sure no problem. I honestly usually don&amp;#39;t care as long as we stay busy and I make my bills. I&amp;#39;m almost done getting my BBA and I&amp;#39;m out ASAP after that. But, as a life long industry person who also is getting a business degree watching my mangers fuck up is so frustrating.

Also because of dyslexia it means I find summarizing things hard so this is super long and I'm also rubbish with grammar. Don't come at me :)

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

As you could tell by my name I work at a pizza place in the UK although I won't say where exactly I work cus you don't really need to know :p

Im 16 and so because of rules and stuff I can't be a waitress so I am a runner. For those who don't know what a runner is it's the same as a waitress however I do not take orders nor do I take drink orders or give people drinks. I also cannot get people the bill as I am not on the electronic system (cus Im a runner not a server) anddd I don't get desserts. My main job is taking starters, mains and sides to tables and if I'm not doing that Im clearing and resetting tables or cleaning the place (like the highchairs/""deep cleaning"" the booths)

Thought I'd also add in the fact that there are 37 tables at the restaurant I work at (1 8 seat, 2 6 seat, the rest are 4/2 seat). So when there are 2 servers on it's split between them so they get about 16 each. So it's more manageable obviously. BUT I'm the only runner at the restaurant (you dont need 2 plus you'd never have 2 on at a time anyways) and being a runner means taking food to all tables and making sure ALL tables are okay and stuff. So although I don't do as much as the servers the job is just as hard as the servers can focus on their half or third of a restaurant while I need to focus on the whole thing :)

Apologies for how long this will be as I'm not the best at summarizing things. :/

Story (it's long sorry!): Also even if you're not gonna read to the end please scroll to the bottom because the last line will make you laugh even without reading everything.

Bad thing #1 - So this Sunday we had 3 Severs, me (runner) and 2 Chefs plus the Assistant Manager. Normally, this would be perfectly fine as Sundays are busy yet not so busy we're rushing about and having to turn people away but you guessed it! Today just happened to be the busiest I have ever seen it (I've worked there about 3/4 months now) and as the restaurant gets to almost full capacity and the tables which are free haven't been cleared yet as no one has had time I make the decision to try and start turning people away so family 1... I tell the mum (who has 3 kids with her) that we won't be able to seat them as we don't have space left. She says ""we'll be quick"" and is begging for a seat so I clear a table and allow them to sit and in my head I was thinking - you might be quick but our kitchen might not be (since they have 5+ tickets and only 2 in the kitchen). Family 2, I thought that it was just 2 people but NOPE their kids were playing so when they asked for a table of 5 I told them we have no tables for 5 available they point out a booth for 4 right next to the entrance and say they'll squish on there and I didn't know how to argue with that so I sat them and then the next table was for 2. This is the first thing that went wrong this day. So I clear a table go to seat them and they go ""oh could we actually get a different table we don't want to be next to kids"".... There were kids EVERYWHERE in the restaurant. So I find this table thats at the back and had to go and clear that one then sat them there and they were happy but I was pretty annoyed cus the restaurant was visibly busy and clearly had very little seats left and on top of this I was mad that they waited for me to clear the table to tell me they didn't want to sit there because it was a waste of time as I had to run food. Anyways after sitting them my manager came and helped me and she was turning people away and saying a 30-45 minute wait.

Bad thing #2 - Fast forward a little while and the next thing goes wrong. So as Im taking a bunch of used cups to the back to be cleaned they shout for service and I say I'll be there in 2 seconds. So I put the cups in the back and decide I'll go back and sort them out later. I grab the food take it to the table (30 seconds after service was shouted) and then ask if they want Parmesan or oils cus that's just what we do where I work. The lady with the pasta asks for parmesan, I go get it and when I come back she goes ""oh and the pasta is cold"" in my head I'm thinking - okay lady this was taken out the oven what? like 2/3 mins ago how on earth is it cold - but I pick it up and apologies and explain that I'll get the kitchen (who have 5-7 tickets to make) to make her another one. Also thought I'd add the point that the bottom of the bowl was still hot like if it was any hotter it would burn my had kinda hot. Anyways I tell the kitchen and the chef turns and goes ""how is it cold?!"" I say idk but the lady said it's cold so can you just make another one cus I don't want to deal with angry customers.

Bad thing #3 - This is a lot shorter than the others. So I'm taking out food and I go to put down a margarita and they go ""there's meant to be extra chicken on that"" They were nice so I was like oh sorry about that let me just go see what happened! went back and check the ticket and the way the app had laid it out meant that both the kitchen and myself had missed the bit that said ""ex chicken"" and so they made another one and it was fine. Shout out to those customers for not making a huge deal about it though!

Bad thing #4 - So remember family 1 from earlier? Well here we go... So at first she complained because her mains were taking too long, which they were! I think the kitchen had muddled up some tickets though. So I apologies and find out her pizza is only just going in like 20-30 minutes after they'd finished their starters. So I tell her this apologies some more cus shes saying stuff like ""it's hard cus i've got 3 kids"" and I understand that but lady you saying this ain't gonna make your pizza cook faster and also I was thinking ""I've got 35+ tables to look after"". So I tell the manager cus it was a long time to wait and I think she got the mains free so thats like £20-30 off the bill. Think thats the end? NOPE, she then wants dessert she orders then asks me how long it's gonna take (She hadn't ordered that long ago but I get the fact she just wanted to leave) as I was away to find out I saw the server going over with them so I just left it. This last bit's a lil funny but basically she'd paid the bill and the server had taken it away and whatever and for some reason this lady didn't realize that she had paid. How? Idk like she would've had to give money and get change/put in her card number so??? but she came up to me and at this point I think she had realized I wasn't a server and went ""You're gonna laugh but can I pay now I ask but..."" Idk what she said but I told the server and she told me she had paid then explained to her that she had paid.

Bad thing #5 - Yes this shift was very eventful... So I was standing at the drinks area getting stuff to clean tables. This lady comes over to the server next to me (I could hear them) and asks for the garlic oil and then goes on to say ""My kids pasta is cold but it doesn't matter anyways because she won't care she'll eat anything put in front of her but I just thought I'd say"" me and the server were kinda like ""uhm okay?"" cus she was complaining but saying it didn't matter so we were like okay so uhm why you tellin us? Cus she said it didn't matter so we weren't gonna go get the manager to give a discount or whatever so idk what she was expecting us to do about it but yeah. Also this was another case of ""cold"" pasta cus I took it over and ik for a fact it was hot cus it was burning my fingers while I was taking it over and by the point she said this it would've cooled down but this was like 10-15 mins later. Also why would you want a 3/4 year olds pasta to be more than look warm?

Bad thing #6 (7 relates to this) - Yup we're on number 6. So we had a table for 10 (it was pre-booked). Yes thats right TEN people!!!! So I wasn't involved in that table as I was asked not to be because they weren't happy and the server didn't want it to be taken out on me :). So what happened was that they're starters took WAY too long to come out like 45 mins late so they got free drinks and stuff and they seemed to be alright with it after but yeah like I said the kitchen was so busy.

Bad thing #7 - We're still going. So we have a work group chat and someone posted a review which said about how ""the table of 10 next to us kept complaining so they had all the staff doing their every will while ignoring everyone else in the restaurant"" Now this review bothered me because like I said in #6 I had nothing to do with this table and the other staff were still paying attention to others but I had absolutely no one say ""excuse me"" or ask me for anything because if someone says ""excuse me"" or when making eye contact kinda waves me over I'll come and help and get whatever you need - even if it's drinks I'll take the order and remember it and tell the server so they can put it through the system and take them drinks. ALSO PLEASE IF YOU DONT WORK IN A RESTURANT YOU SHOULD TAKE NOTE OF THIS: If you just stare at a server they don't know what you want... They don't know if you want them to come over or if you're just blanked out. So please just wave us over or say excuse me :).

Bad thing #8 - I think this is the last thing :D So I was cleaning a table and all I hear is ""EXCUSE MEEEEE"" but in a somewhat rude way and idk where it's coming or if it's for me and then I hear it again so I'm like okay where's it coming from look around and see this lady on the other side of the booth (Our booths have a wall thing at 1 side of them cus thats just how the restaurant was designed) so she's looking over the wall and I see her and I'm like ""oh hey whats up?"" she asks for the bill I'm like yeah sure what table you at, she tells me and I turn to go find someone to get it for her and then there's this other lady and I'm like ""hi"" and she just quickly goes ""I'd like to order dessert"" and I go to ask if she'd like the menu cus if she already had one someone would've been to her to take the order but before I can get a word out of my mouth she goes "" a honeycomb cream slice"" I think that's what it's called anyways :/ Like I said I don't make desserts or take the order :) SOOOOO I go and ask someone to take the bill to that lady and then ask for them to get a honeycomb cream thingy for the other lady and then I go to clean another table and BOOM ""excuse me"" and I turn to see another different lady and she also asks for the bill then on the way to get the right server 2 other people ask for the bill. Please if you've seen someone ask a server/runner to do something and they're away to do it don't interupt them this sounds harsh but for me anyways I can take up to like 2 tables orders/needs at once so remembering the 3 tables was confusing. Especially since I had to find the right server for each table :)

Once again sorry for how long this was :D

I'd like to add that I only do 3 hour shifts and all of these things happened within 3 hours :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my first ever post and I have dyslexia so if things are not the correct spelling that&amp;#39;s why.

&lt;p&gt;Bad thing #4 - So remember family 1 from earlier? Well here we go... So at first she complained because her mains were taking too long, which they were! I think the kitchen had muddled up some tickets though. So I apologies and find out her pizza is only just going in like 20-30 minutes after they&amp;#39;d finished their starters. So I tell her this apologies some more cus shes saying stuff like &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s hard cus i&amp;#39;ve got 3 kids&amp;quot; and I understand that but lady you saying this ain&amp;#39;t gonna make your pizza cook faster and also I was thinking &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve got 35+ tables to look after&amp;quot;. So I tell the manager cus it was a long time to wait and I think she got the mains free so thats like £20-30 off the bill. Think thats the end? NOPE, she then wants dessert she orders then asks me how long it&amp;#39;s gonna take (She hadn&amp;#39;t ordered that long ago but I get the fact she just wanted to leave) as I was away to find out I saw the server going over with them so I just left it. This last bit&amp;#39;s a lil funny but basically she&amp;#39;d paid the bill and the server had taken it away and whatever and for some reason this lady didn&amp;#39;t realize that she had paid. How? Idk like she would&amp;#39;ve had to give money and get change/put in her card number so??? but she came up to me and at this point I think she had realized I wasn&amp;#39;t a server and went &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re gonna laugh but can I pay now I ask but...&amp;quot; Idk what she said but I told the server and she told me she had paid then explained to her that she had paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad thing #5 - Yes this shift was very eventful... So I was standing at the drinks area getting stuff to clean tables. This lady comes over to the server next to me (I could hear them) and asks for the garlic oil and then goes on to say &amp;quot;My kids pasta is cold but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter anyways because she won&amp;#39;t care she&amp;#39;ll eat anything put in front of her but I just thought I&amp;#39;d say&amp;quot; me and the server were kinda like &amp;quot;uhm okay?&amp;quot; cus she was complaining but saying it didn&amp;#39;t matter so we were like okay so uhm why you tellin us? Cus she said it didn&amp;#39;t matter so we weren&amp;#39;t gonna go get the manager to give a discount or whatever so idk what she was expecting us to do about it but yeah. Also this was another case of &amp;quot;cold&amp;quot; pasta cus I took it over and ik for a fact it was hot cus it was burning my fingers while I was taking it over and by the point she said this it would&amp;#39;ve cooled down but this was like 10-15 mins later. Also why would you want a 3/4 year olds pasta to be more than look warm?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad thing #6 (7 relates to this) - Yup we&amp;#39;re on number 6. So we had a table for 10 (it was pre-booked). Yes thats right TEN people!!!! So I wasn&amp;#39;t involved in that table as I was asked not to be because they weren&amp;#39;t happy and the server didn&amp;#39;t want it to be taken out on me :). So what happened was that they&amp;#39;re starters took WAY too long to come out like 45 mins late so they got free drinks and stuff and they seemed to be alright with it after but yeah like I said the kitchen was so busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad thing #7 - We&amp;#39;re still going. So we have a work group chat and someone posted a review which said about how &amp;quot;the table of 10 next to us kept complaining so they had all the staff doing their every will while ignoring everyone else in the restaurant&amp;quot; Now this review bothered me because like I said in #6 I had nothing to do with this table and the other staff were still paying attention to others but I had absolutely no one say &amp;quot;excuse me&amp;quot; or ask me for anything because if someone says &amp;quot;excuse me&amp;quot; or when making eye contact kinda waves me over I&amp;#39;ll come and help and get whatever you need - even if it&amp;#39;s drinks I&amp;#39;ll take the order and remember it and tell the server so they can put it through the system and take them drinks. ALSO PLEASE IF YOU DONT WORK IN A RESTURANT YOU SHOULD TAKE NOTE OF THIS: If you just stare at a server they don&amp;#39;t know what you want... They don&amp;#39;t know if you want them to come over or if you&amp;#39;re just blanked out. So please just wave us over or say excuse me :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad thing #8 - I think this is the last thing :D So I was cleaning a table and all I hear is &amp;quot;EXCUSE MEEEEE&amp;quot; but in a somewhat rude way and idk where it&amp;#39;s coming or if it&amp;#39;s for me and then I hear it again so I&amp;#39;m like okay where&amp;#39;s it coming from look around and see this lady on the other side of the booth (Our booths have a wall thing at 1 side of them cus thats just how the restaurant was designed) so she&amp;#39;s looking over the wall and I see her and I&amp;#39;m like &amp;quot;oh hey whats up?&amp;quot; she asks for the bill I&amp;#39;m like yeah sure what table you at, she tells me and I turn to go find someone to get it for her and then there&amp;#39;s this other lady and I&amp;#39;m like &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot; and she just quickly goes &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d like to order dessert&amp;quot; and I go to ask if she&amp;#39;d like the menu cus if she already had one someone would&amp;#39;ve been to her to take the order but before I can get a word out of my mouth she goes &amp;quot; a honeycomb cream slice&amp;quot; I think that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s called anyways :/ Like I said I don&amp;#39;t make desserts or take the order :) SOOOOO I go and ask someone to take the bill to that lady and then ask for them to get a honeycomb cream thingy for the other lady and then I go to clean another table and BOOM &amp;quot;excuse me&amp;quot; and I turn to see another different lady and she also asks for the bill then on the way to get the right server 2 other people ask for the bill. Please if you&amp;#39;ve seen someone ask a server/runner to do something and they&amp;#39;re away to do it don&amp;#39;t interupt them this sounds harsh but for me anyways I can take up to like 2 tables orders/needs at once so remembering the 3 tables was confusing. Especially since I had to find the right server for each table :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again sorry for how long this was :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to add that I only do 3 hour shifts and all of these things happened within 3 hours :)&lt;/p&gt;

Todd came into the restaurant I manage about six months ago looking to apply. I sat down with him and after just a few minutes of chatting, I realized his availability and what we needed did not coincide; so that’s what I told him and he went on his way. 
That night he followed me on Instagram. I have a funky name that’s hard to spell so how he found my account is beyond me. 
Eventually I started watching Todd’s stories, as they were entertaining in a 30 y/o man child kind of way. He would consistently reply to my stories even though I never replied back to them. 
Fast forward a few months. Todd comes back into the restaurant, looks at me, and says, “oh hey, you’re *my roommates name*, right?” 
No, Todd. And that’s weird?
Now he comes in almost every day and looks for my eye contact - once he finds it, he approaches and dumps his entire life on me. 
I know more about this guy than I ever needed to know and he doesn’t even care to ask my name. 
I started to think he was hitting on me - he would invite me to events in the city and even brought me weed to work once?! (I didn’t ask for any of this. I give him the same customer service I give anyone else.) I started dropping hits about being in a long term relationship... so he started inviting me AND my boyfriend to things? No thank you. 
This week he told me he starting seeing a new girl. But this new girl has a boyfriend. And that’s how all of his relationships have started. By infringing on someone else’s relationship. 
All of my employees know how I feel about this guy so I’ve started to completely avoid him when he comes in. It’s to the point where I am uncomfortable. 

I genuinely think he struggles with social interactions and doesn’t pick up on cues or even understands that I am there to serve him food, not to listen to his woes. 
I feel bad sometimes because I think he’s just looking for friends, but that’s not my job. I’m not interested in getting to know this guy because he weirds me out in a million different ways. I’ve been told I’m too nice, and I really don’t know how to handle this situation if things get weirder.

I (25f) am a bartender at a wing restaurant I have worked there way to long and in my years working there I have had a couple that regularly comes in. They are my least favorite table to take care of but of course I’m polite as it is my job to do so, they run me around, will literally ask me something then ignore me to make out with each other while I’m standing there, they don’t tip, and my favorite thing they do is order food eat til they are full then demand it get taken off the bill because they didn’t like it. 

Well they came in last week during a football game and my rail was full so they had to take a table, they wanted a different table but it was football Sunday and we didn’t have a single table open and there was a wait. I informed them of this politely and they demanded money off their bill since they couldn’t sit where they wanted, I ignored it and just walked away. Then they were ready to order and let me tell you they put any modification or specifications they possibly can in hopes it gets messed up and they don’t have to pay. Even wanted a discount because we didn’t have avocado for her burger. At this point I am frustrated O have 7 other tables and a full bar rail and I am responsible for ever beer or mixed drink being served in the entire restaurant. I take their order and walk away. They see a table open on the bar and run for it without asking, whatever i don’t care move. 

Food comes out and I made sure they had refills, silverware, and napkins beforehand so i wouldn’t have to check on them right away. I wait til I see about 3/4 of their meals are gone and go check on them and of
 course I get “ this wasn’t cooked right” “I didn’t like it” “ we don’t want to pay for this I need it remade and put in a to go box”. To which I replied “ladies you ate the majority of your meals and I can see from here your burgers were cooked extra well done just like you asked you do this every time you are here I’m sorry but we won’t be taking anything off your bill”, of course they ask for a manager who tells them the same thing. They then go on a rant about how we are all racists (they are African American) and hate gay couples all because we won’t give them the food they ATE for free. I am absolutely fed up at this point in the middle of their rant I put the bill on the table
And the older woman throws it across the room. My
Manager went to them put the bill back on the table
And said “you will pay this in full and you will not come back or we can call the police and you will not come back”.

I'll give some background first. 

I'm from a small town up North (less than 10,000 ppl), and have only served at a couple places. They've all been the standard mom and pop operations that close at like 9pm.

I've recently moved to a bigger city and luckily found a job pretty easily. It's a convenient location (a short walk from my apartment), a huge building, and it's ALWAYS busy. Every night there's a line up out the door.

I've only been working there for a couple weeks, and have started doing end of night stocking. This means I need to go into the basement. 

Which leads me to the problem. 

Every time I go down to the storage rooms/fridges I've seen cockroaches, one or two out chilling in the open. What's worse is that staff don't seem to care. Servers who have been working there 5-10+ years are completely unbothered by it, and their comments lead me to believe it's a long ongoing problem. Two nights ago there was a cockroach on a beer glass after I set it on the bar. 

Like I said, I'm from a small town up North (think kind of like cottage country vibe). We don't have cockroaches. The worst you worry about is field mice getting into your insulation. I'd literally never even seen a cockroach before this.

So correct me if I'm wrong, but this and the staff apathy is messed up right? Please tell me this isn't normal/acceptable in cities. I'm paranoid that I'm going to bring something home. I've begun bringing a plastic bag to seal my belongings in the meantime.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only been working there for a couple weeks, and have started doing end of night stocking. This means I need to go into the basement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to the problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I go down to the storage rooms/fridges I&amp;#39;ve seen cockroaches, one or two out chilling in the open. What&amp;#39;s worse is that staff don&amp;#39;t seem to care. Servers who have been working there 5-10+ years are completely unbothered by it, and their comments lead me to believe it&amp;#39;s a long ongoing problem. Two nights ago there was a cockroach on a beer glass after I set it on the bar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I&amp;#39;m from a small town up North (think kind of like cottage country vibe). We don&amp;#39;t have cockroaches. The worst you worry about is field mice getting into your insulation. I&amp;#39;d literally never even seen a cockroach before this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong, but this and the staff apathy is messed up right? Please tell me this isn&amp;#39;t normal/acceptable in cities. I&amp;#39;m paranoid that I&amp;#39;m going to bring something home. I&amp;#39;ve begun bringing a plastic bag to seal my belongings in the meantime. I&amp;#39;m so grossed out, but can&amp;#39;t exactly afford to quit without another job lined up.&lt;/p&gt;

I started as server, moved to bartending, supervisor, manager and now I own my own restaurant. 

So, my husband is bad at planning things and never really planned a “date” per se. 

SO, our anniversary came up and I did not expect him to have planned anything, BUT he told me to get ready. I was so excited! 

We start driving and we pulled up to a restaurant that is fairly close to the restaurant I own, but I had never been to. I immediately was hesitant, as I know that a lot of my customers also go to this place. I was still excited nonetheless. I just jokingly told him “don’t be surprised if I know people here”. He laughed and we went in. 

When we met the hostess she asked where we wanted to eat and I suggested on the patio (as I had already seen people I know inside). He agreed and we were seated.

We ordered drinks and apps and after about 20ish minutes I had to use the restroom, so I went inside. 

I went inside and saw one of my semi-regulars from my restaurant, so I felt obligated to say hi. I walked towards them and began saying hi when I was interrupted by asking “why is a double gin and tonic $16”. I immediately tried to explain that I do not charge $16 for a double gin and tonic, but I was interrupted again. He began saying “At least your spaghetti is better than the place up the road” MY RESTAURANT! I was taken so off guard. I couldn’t even speak. He began asking me if Trevor was still in the kitchen and where George was. He kept going on and on about how MY RESTAURANT needs to work on their Italian and that “they” need cooks like Trevor. He kept asking about George and how he needs to work on his prices “because the food is more authentic than *my restaurant*, but the prices were too high”. He kept going on “MY RESTAURANT needed improvements to compete with this place and claim to be Italian”.

I finally just interrupted loudly and said “I don’t know why things are the way they are here, because I don’t work here”. He looked so puzzled. He then said “Oh you work at *my restaurant* that’s right (most people think I just work there as I try to blend in, I’m female and I’m young)”. I said “yeah and I have to use the restroom. Have a good night”. 

At this point I had been gone from my husband for 20 minutes and when I came back he was annoyed. I was too and had just been bashed to my face. I felt the air leave my body and just felt defeated, on my anniversary! 

The rest of the dinner was somewhat somber after I explained what had just happened. I was upset, my husband was upset and we were just trying to have a nice night out. It felt forced at this point. 

After about 15 minutes the guy from inside  goes to leave and has to walk past the patio where we are seated. He stopped and ACROSS THE PATIO with other tables seated he shouted “I’m sorry for what I said. I just think that if you’re going to call yourself an Italian restaurant, you should have better spaghetti”. My gut dropped. I was so embarrassed. 

Before skipping a beat my husband yells “Maybe if you paid attention, you’d know that *my restaurant* is NOT Italian!”

The guy just slowly walked away dumbfounded. For all the happy hours the guy has been In for, he ASSUMED we were Italian. We are not, nor have we ever claimed to be. We have won Best Italian 3 years in a row (this restaurant didn’t even place) but we are an American Bistro. NOT ITALIAN! 

Our spaghetti is really good BTW. 

Although it was a shitty experience, my husband absolutely save the day by shutting the MFer down and I was so grateful.

I was about 3 weeks into my new job (bartender and waitress) and we had a table of 6 come in. 

Everyone was lovely and everything was going smooth until they had to pay the bill.

The man who was paying for it comes up to pay and I print off the bill and as I'm doing that he turns around to his table and does something (I can only guess it was a wink)

It was about halfway through the transaction that he says to me ""you've done a great job tonight"" whilst staring down my top (I'm not that short that you can see down my top, I'm 5'7ish )
I tell him thank you and continue with the transaction.

He then goes on to ask about if I've got a boyfriend and so on.

Once the transaction was done he goes back to his table and I notice an older lady (65-70) filming and as soon as he sits down she asks him "" so, how was she?"" In a very hinting voice.

I'm glad to say they have never come back after my boss (6'4, covered in tattoos and looks like he can crush a head with one hand)glared at them for the next 20 minutes.

This summer, I worked the dinner shift at a local restaurant. The staff was small, 2 in FOH and 3/4 in the back, since we only had 13 tables. 

We always had a ton of clean silverware before dinner started so nobody had to step away to do dishes during the dinner rush. I was waiting on a table of two parents and their child, who was around 6 or 7. I gave them their silverware, filled water glasses and left for them to look at the menu. We are absolutely slammed because it’s 6pm on a Friday night and we have dine in and takeout orders up the ass. 

Not even 5 minutes later i hear someone dropping silverware. I turn and it’s the kid from the table i just left throwing his fork and both his parents’ forks on the ground. I pick them up, put them in the back, and replace the forks. 

I come back to take their order, and you guessed it, all 3 forks on the ground again. I take the order, replace and pick the dirty forks up, and ask the parents if they would like me to grab their kid something to play with until dinner gets there. They say no, I hustle my ass and put the forks back in the sink. 

This happened 3 more times before their food got sent out (maybe a 20-25 minute wait) and if you’re keeping count that’s 15 forks. Food arrives. I continue my job. All is well. Until i hear more FUCKING FORKS ON THE GROUND. By this time I can almost hear it before they hit the tile. We are now up to 18 forks. I do my little “would you like me to take those” speech and put them in the sink again. They eventually leave and we’re still slammed. By 8pm, we have no more forks left and we close at 10. I know exactly why we have no forks. I had to leave the floor and wash them all before my coworker had to explain to 30 people why we don’t have silverware.

It’s a great summer job when I’m on break from college and I’m going to get trained as a server soon.

I was hosting on a Friday night as the lead host (we usually have 2-5 hosts up front so we can seat a lot of people very quickly) and we were absolutely swamped since it was a Friday night. We had several parties on the waitlist with 30-45 minute waits for small parties in a medium sized dining room. We have open seating at the bar and high tops in the bar area which often serves as a nice alternative for people who don’t really care where they’re sat, and we also have a pretty big patio that usually stays pretty open since it gets hot where we are. 

While this busy night is going on, we have someone walk up and I ask how many. 

“There’s gonna be 11 of us.”

Yikes. The biggest tables we have inside seat 7 people max, so we would definitely have to pull tables together which is very difficult on a night like this. 

I offer, “Alright, so if y’all are willing to go outside we could seat everyone right away. For seating inside the wait for 11 will be 45 minutes to an hour.”

They opt to sit inside, so I take down their name and put them on the waiting list. 

Time goes on and we remain busy for quite some time, and someone from the party comes in and checks several times if their table will be ready soon. I finally find some tables I can get together and at this point the party has been waiting for 50 minutes. I have the other hosts start pulling the tables together and I go outside and ask for the party of 11 at which point they all start getting up and I realize the mistake I made so I quickly say “y’all’s table is *almost* ready we’re pulling the tables together right now” and they get upset with me for “teasing” them but I shake it off and go inside and check on the tables and I see they’re ready so I go back out and call them in for real this time. We had quoted them an hour wait time on one of the busiest nights I’ve ever worked and got them sat in 55 minutes which I was pretty proud of. 

As I’m welcoming them inside, an older man with the party asks me “So what are gonna put in for us?” and I didn’t really understand what he was saying so I asked what he meant and he kept repeating the same thing at which point someone else a little younger chimed in with “For making us wait for so long, what are you gonna put in? Free appetizers all around?” 

I was kind of taken aback because this is my first hosting or restaurant job and I had never had a request like that, so I just said something about how I’ll go check with the manager. 

I go into the kitchen and see two managers, both of whom I have a good working relationship with, and I basically said “Alright look- we quoted this party of 11 an hour wait time and got them seated in 55 minutes and now they’re asking for free food because of how long they waited. What should I tell them?” And one of the managers said he’ll go talk to them and the absolute most we’re giving them is a couple free quesos but that’s it. 

The rush calmed down pretty soon after that and we had an easy rest of the night but I kept thinking all the while about these people who felt like they could get some free shit for waiting exactly as long as I told them they would for coming with a party of 11 during rush hour on a Friday.

We combined 2 tables and placed a reserved sign to prepare for it and gave the server a heads up.

Confused, I said ok and rummaged through the hostess stand for like 3 minutes bc I'm still in training, meanwhile lady is waiting there with me.

The bench seating is free so I seat the party of 3 that just walked in, give them menus and glasses for water. 2 minutes later a 4 seat table opens up so they choose to move themselves to be more comfortable - no big deal because I notice them moving. I come over to take their drinks order but they said they&amp;#39;re fine with water and ask for 3 glasses... The 3 glasses I had just given them at the bench seating!! They order their food and say they&amp;#39;re in a hurry so need to be done in 30 minutes. I told them we were busy so it may be a longer than usual wait for food, if they want something quick they can order food from the cabinet (toasted sandwiches etc.).  They told me no, they wanted food off the menu. It took 20 minutes to be cooked and they complained to me that they were in a hurry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would you order off the menu when your server says that&amp;#39;s going to take longer and you know you&amp;#39;re in a hurry?&lt;/p&gt;

Since there are only 4 employees and one of them is her daughter, this meant half the staff was out. I took as many hours as I could because normally I'm very part time. My other coworker is a lazy idiot, so I spent my shifts after him cleaning up his mistakes. 

So one Sunday, I'm the only one working all day. This is a small cafe/coffee shop, with a fire code max of 15 people, including the worker. I got slammed. It was non-stop customers for 2 hours, with over 40 people in the shop at all times. I started printing tickets to keep track of all the orders, but as it is a coffee shop, plain drip coffee or tea is going to be faster than an 8   shot espresso drink - especially when the machine makes 2 shots at a time, each individually ground out and poured. 

So a hippie type girl and her boyfriend come in the middle of this madness. They have a total of 12 shots needed for their drinks. Another fun piece - we only have 3 steaming cups - so after those 3, I have to wash them and start over. There were about 10 drinks in line ahead of these two. 

I'm running around like a headless chicken between taking orders, making drinks, and making food, mainly trying to get people out. After about 5 minutes, the man with hippie girl stops to check on his drinks. No, I didn't forget, yes, I will be getting to them, and there are still orders ahead of you. Another five minutes, he's back. I'm still running, and having to stop to have these conversations. The fourth time, she comes up to me, and I'm so done with them I say I'll do it right now. The girl stared at me the entire time I sat and made their drinks. I start mixing their drinks, steam their milk, get it poured. I handed her the drinks and apologized, again, and let her know if she chooses to come back it won't be so crazy. She tells me to breath. 

I managed to finish the rush when my husband showed up to drop off groceries and I forced him to start working - at a job he knows nothing about. Several groups waited it out so they could actually exit the shop, and stopped to tell me what a great job I did handling everything, and how crazy the whole thing had been. I was happy it was over. 

 Then I see THE REVIEW. Now, it might seem offensive that I keep saying ""hippie girl,"" but that's what she is. I saw her FB through a mutual friend. She posts about her smoking pot rights and how to stay mellow, and manages a massage parlor. The mutual friend is also a very free-spirited hippie type person, super mellow and lovely.  The review went on to say how I gave her cold drinks (that I made in front of her, with no time to cool), my apologies made her uncomfortable, and I was obviously untrained because I didn't take one order at time and complete the entire order before speaking to a new customer. It's mean spirited and nasty, and she ends it with ""I'm not complaining- relax girl, you got this"" - which I'm assuming she posted in order to feel better about her bitchiness. The review goes on and on, basically attacking every part of me with her attempt at witticism. One day after posting it, she removed her name. 

It kills me because 1- She could have said something to me at the time. 2- She seriously spends half a paragraph complaining about my apologies for the wait. Another customer of mine mentioned to me how he watched her and her man friend ping pong back and forth to me until they got their order and left. Of course I apologized to someone freaking out about the wait. 3- Her review is full of lies. Her drinks weren't cold because the milk sat while I stirred flavor syrup into espresso for 10 seconds. That's how we make every drink. If you've ever ordered from a coffeehouse, the drinks are usually too hot to even drink right away. And she accused me of sending away a coworker because some ""deeper reasoning"" prevented me from accepting help - but there was no coworker. It was my poor husband, who brought in groceries and did begin to help me. 

Of the whole awful experience, I had exactly 2 sets of customers get upset - both young millennials. Everyone else was very understanding that if you walk into a coffee shop with a line out the door, you're going to have to wait a bit for your order. It's just the way it is. If you don't want to wait, walk exactly 2 blocks away to the two other coffee shops that are much larger. 

I wish that I could respond to the review to set her straight, but as it is, I'm practicing my response for when she comes in again - she claimed she'd be back.

It's been utter and complete shit. I work at a fast-paced corporate tex-mex restaurant in a suburb...

This is food that we are paid 70%ish of the menu price on according to our contract... If something is wrong with the delivery, we are charged a fee that is more expensive than most of our cheap AF menu items. This may make sense, but they had the wrong menu for a month, and apparently we were getting hit for not including food on items that do not go on there (jalapenos on burgers that don't get them, etc.)

Our GM instituted a rule to not remake any food from this app because it was already lower profit. It's been suggested that we start making the food when the driver gets here, but with our electronic ordering system that would be tricky to implement.

Recently I came into work and we had a new corporate pamphlet about what to do when there's an issue with a delivery order... we've only been partnered a month or two and already there's an official corporate communication about what to do if there are PROBLEMS. Nothing positive about the app is said at all in the entire pamplet, which is miles away from what corporate was saying initially.

I find it extremely funny because if you read between the lines, there must be tonnes of issues... The specific issue of the delivery driver being late was mentioned and we are being told to call the apps customer service line if the driver is late (like we have time for that.)

I'm finding this sort of funny because our GM recently started keeping physical receipt for each app order with the pickup time on it... it's not looking good. How are these apps getting business?

P.S. Recently a guy called in asking about a delivery with a pickup time of 8:30 at 10:30. I had the pleasure of telling him the food had been made on time and was just sitting there. I suggested he contact their customer service line. Delivery driver arrived 15 minutes later...

A lot of rich people that are looking to party are attracted to where I live. Basically everything here revolves around tourism, so naturally we have a lot of immigrants aswell. 

The eventual language barrier between the staff, plus an annoying boss/drunk customer can lead to pretty tense situations. I've seen quite a few people snap, and these are some of the best ""you won't believe what happened"" stories the staff always told the new employees during lunch:

1) The Russian Grill Master and the Ukrainian Samurai Lady - 

This happened at a restaurant I briefly worked at early in my career. The boss was quite a douche. We all knew it, but needed the cash. He hired lots of immigrants who barely spoke the language for poor money, and let them work in the kitchen... his reasoning was that ""they don't have to talk to the customer anyways"". One of them was the Russian Grill Master, we'll call him Dimitri. He stood at over 2m, and was a goddamn giant. Let me mention, the boss (I'll refer to him as Gremlin from now on) was quite short, he was only about 1'65m. The Ukrainian Samurai Lady was another one of the ""candidates"" for this great, great, job. Her name will be Olga. 

Gremlin had a bad habit of yelling at the employees, even infront of customers. And so did his wife, also an Ukrainian woman I'll call Baba Yaga. Boy she had a temper. Gremlin took care of ""supervising"" us from the service staff, while Baba Yaga unleashed her fury upon the kitchen staff. 

Every day you'd get yelled at by these two psychos. Most people quit during the first few months, including myself and another guy who started there with me. 

One day there was an argument between Dimitri and Baba Yaga over how some of the meat on the grill should be prepared. You could hear it from the inside of the dining area, so Gremlin noticed the action and decided to join in on the fun.

After a lot of arguing, Dimitri finally had enough. He put his hand around Gremlin's throat and lifted him high up. It wasn't easy to keep in the laughter at the sight of his little legs frantically kicking the air. Dimitri  didn't hurt him though, and quit his job the same afternoon. 

One day, there was an argument Between Olga and Baba Yaga over how some of the food in the kitchen should be prepared. As always you could hear it all the way from the inside of the dining area, so Gremlin decided to go see what's up (notice a pattern?). 

Just like Dimitri, Olga eventually snapped. But unlike the Russian Giant, she is armed with her trusty kitchen knife. I was working inside the dining area. The restaurant has a huge glass wall facing the street, and around the corner is the backdoor exit from the kitchen. Imagine my face when suddenly seeing Gremlin sprint by, followed by Olga wielding a knife. 

It does make me feel sorry about Gremlin when I think about it. His wife sets all these fires and he always ends up getting burned. 

2) Alcohol and arguing with the wife, a classic - 

These events took place a good while after I quit the previously mentioned job. By now, I was managing a bar inside a five star hotel. This means; talking to and taking care of customers, supervising that everything runs smoothly and lend a hand should it be necessary. We had a total of 160 tables, and two stages for shows.

It was during one of these shows that a family of three appeared. A man in his forties, his wife and his daughter. At first it's going well, but as time progresses and he gets more drunk, his family starts feeling increasingly embarrassed.

At some point they're having a loud argument right beside the counter and his wife and daughter leave back to their room. He's obviously upset, and asks me for some tequila. I oblige. He keeps drinking shot after shot, but I've been far more wasted than that and did fine, so I gave him some more.

By now the tequila looks like it really starts kicking in and I tell him he had enough for the night... But he refuses to leave before having one last vodka &amp; coke, so I just put some water in there instead and give him that (free of charge ofc).

Not even a few sips into it he drops the glass. No big deal. I call one of my coworkers to clean it up and tell the customer to go sit down somewhere else in the meantime. He was wearing sandals but ignored my advice and started stumbling around barefoot anyways. I was just baffled that he didn't hurt himself with the amount of times he forgot to put on his shoes. 

Finally, he decides to go to his room. But he isn't able to walk the long way inside the complex by himself, let alone find it, so the bellboy ends up driving him around on the cart-thingy they use to transport the luggage. Half an hour later the bellboy is back, telling me that the wife refuses to let him into the room. Awesome. What now? - I ask.

In the end we just brought him into the spa and let him sleep in the massage chair. Must have slept like a baby. Also, I got a nice tip when they checked out.

3) The one-weekend long nerd mega party -

This hotel I mentioned before is where I worked most the time of my career. The complex was huge. We had five restaurants and three bars; a Buffet, Italian, Mediterranean, Sushi, Grill, Cafeteria, the main Bar and a Bar inside the Pool. We also did events for larger groups of people who could afford to rent out the whole upper floors. On the rooftop there was a big room to host presentations, and it's where most of the action took place.

There was this huge group of around two hundred rich nerds that spent a weekend at the hotel when one of the new Star Wars movies came out. Holy crap, these people party like it's their last day on earth. I'm talking girls stripping, prostitutes, drugs, orgies, etc...

They rented out all of the upper floors though, so most of the other guests were completely oblivious to what was going on. But not us, from the bar staff. Because it's the only department in the hotel that focuses on this aspect of gastronomy, not fine dining, and it's the department I was in charge of... I also took care of the event. Me and a handful of coworkers were the only ones allowed to go up there and knew exactly what's up.

The first thing you saw when reaching the top of the stairs (most guests would take the elevator) was a threesome between some furries, two guys and a girl. Once they finished they just left the condoms laying there and went back to the party. A few of them of them even took the elevator down into our storage area. 

Not all of it was bad tough. Some of the girls were legit 10/10's dragging around a dude in a Darth Vader mask carrying a plastic lightsword.

I remember kids in the hotel getting excited about seeing the ""giant fluffy animals"". Thank God for their ignorance...

While the event on the rooftop went by relatively calm, by the time I was informed about what was going on in the storage area, it was a blurr of alcohol, sex and drugs. A lot of them were cheating, and one even offered me a hundred bucks worth of cocaine to let them keep doing what they were doing so he didn't have to go to his room. Needless to say l rejected the offer.

4) Who let the dogs out? -

This is the last one of my stories. It's the most recent one and happened two years ago. I was backpacking in another country and worked at a hostel as a barista. Part of why I took that job was because we didn't have to pay any rent in exchange for our work. This meant you would have to take turns with the other employees to cover the night shift though, because someone always had to be available in case of an emergency.

One of the new employees was a very attractive Brazilian girl, we'll call her Maria. She had her own apartment near the hostel, and would come over every now and then to do the night shift. Since some other coworkers and me always used to stay up late and there was mostly nothing to do, she often joined us. 

One of our regular customers who also stayed for a longer time at the hostel was the Terminator. Some dude from the islands in New Zealand, built like a brick. He seemed like a nice guy though for all I could tell.

During one night at about 03:00 am, a few minutes after we finished work, me and my roommate are smoking a joint while listening to some music. All of a sudden we hear a single, incredibly loud scream. The kind of scream that the antagonist always does in movies, do you know what I mean? No emotions in it at all, just pure craziness.

It was very unpleasant to hear, and I immediately got up to go tell whoever it was to tone it down. We have other guests that are staying there too after all. But my roommate, a French guy who always had my back (shoutout, brother!), told me to give it a few minutes to see if it stops. I'll call him Alex. 

It did, for about an hour. Then again... this scream that seemed inhuman. By now, Alex also had enough and didn't say a word when I got up. 

I walked down the stairs towards the patio, there was already a confused guest wondering what's going on. Just as I ask him if he knows what all the commotion is about, Terminator shows up. I've been around and have seen some shit, but the look in this guy's eyes is one of the scariest things I've ever seen in my life. This is what I can remember of the conversation:

- Terminator: ""Nero9073! Oh Nero9073, I'm so glad I found you. Did you see him?""

- Me: ""Uh, see who? What is going on?""

- Terminator: ""Just tell me where he went.""

- Me: ""What are you talking about man? Where went who?""

- Terminator: ""I KNOW you've seen him.""

By now, Alex has also arrived and is just as confused as everyone else. 

- Me: ""Seen who!? You need to elaborate a bit if you want me to help you."" 

- Terminator: *Puts hands on my shoulders* ""He JUST went past here. WHERE DID HE GO!?"" 

At this point I realize that something is wrong. The look in his eyes and the nonsense he was talking made it clear. Maria, who is on nightshift duty also shows up. 

- Me: ""Listen man, I have no idea what you're talking about, and to be honest you're freaking me out. Is everything okay?"". 

- Terminator: ""Oh no. He told you, right? Oh no. Oh no."" 

- Me: ""Calm down, we can sort this out. Just tell me what's going on.""

- Terminator: *Grabbing my shoulders harder and harder* ""TELL ME WHERE HE IS. I NEED TO KNOW.""

- Alex: ""Ay man, not cool! Let go of him!"" 

- Me: *grabbing his wrists, trying to restrain him a bit* ""Calm down! I didn't see anyone, only those of us who are standing here!""

Terminator takes a look around and sees Maria, who is standing a few meters behind Alex, and goes completely crazy. He yanks his wrists out of my hands and runs straight at her. Luckily, Alex and the other guest manage to step in.

Meanwhile, Maria is frozen in shock and just stands there, puzzled. Alex and the guest are each holding him by an arm, while he still tries to run at Maria like a zombie. I get behind him, and put him in a chokehold.

It took three grown men to restrain the guy. I told Maria to go and call the cops, then lock herself into a room. Almost half the hostel is awake by now and his best friend (the guy who was traveling with him) finally was there to help, or better said, tried.

He started talking to Terminator, and for a second it actually looked like he was calming down once he saw him, but it was a trick. Once his friend convinced us that he was calm enough for me to not choke him anymore, he pulled himself free and bolted across the hostel looking for Maria. His friend and the rest of us are in hot pursuit, and once he hears the cops he jumps over a fence onto the street.

He didn't get very far, there was probably like half a dozen cop cars, dogs and even more officers. We all stood there, watching the silhouette of him run across the street to the sound of barking, untill the dogs caught up and mauled him. He was arrested, still screaming like a lunatic. By the next day he had already left the hostel. Maria quit her job shortly after and moved somewhere else. I never got to know exactly what it was that made him act that way... but I recall Alex telling me, and I quote; ""when he looked at Maria who was standing behind me, it was as if he looked straight through me. Like an animal laying eyes on it's prey"". Our guess was Ice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working in gastronomy for over six years now, and had quite a few interesting experiences.

On the rooftop there was a big room to host presentations, and it&amp;#39;s where most of the action took place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was this huge group of around two hundred rich nerds that spent a weekend at the hotel when one of the new Star Wars movies came out. Holy crap, these people party like it&amp;#39;s their last day on earth. I&amp;#39;m talking girls stripping, prostitutes, drugs, orgies, etc...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They rented out all of the upper floors though, so most of the other guests were completely oblivious to what was going on. But not us, from the bar staff. Because it&amp;#39;s the only department in the hotel that focuses on this aspect of gastronomy, not fine dining, and it&amp;#39;s the department I was in charge of... I also took care of the event. Me and a handful of coworkers were the only ones allowed to go up there and knew exactly what&amp;#39;s up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you saw when reaching the top of the stairs (most guests would take the elevator) was a threesome between some furries, two guys and a girl. Once they finished they just left the condoms laying there and went back to the party. A few of them of them even took the elevator down into our storage area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of it was bad tough. Some of the girls were legit 10/10&amp;#39;s dragging around a dude in a Darth Vader mask carrying a plastic lightsword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember kids in the hotel getting excited about seeing the &amp;quot;giant fluffy animals&amp;quot;. Thank God for their ignorance...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the event on the rooftop went by relatively calm, by the time I was informed about what was going on in the storage area, it was a blurr of alcohol, sex and drugs. A lot of them were cheating, and one even offered me a hundred bucks worth of cocaine to let them keep doing what they were doing so he didn&amp;#39;t have to go to his room. Needless to say l rejected the offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Who let the dogs out? -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the last one of my stories. It&amp;#39;s the most recent one and happened two years ago. I was backpacking in another country and worked at a hostel as a barista. Part of why I took that job was because we didn&amp;#39;t have to pay any rent in exchange for our work. This meant you would have to take turns with the other employees to cover the night shift though, because someone always had to be available in case of an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the new employees was a very attractive Brazilian girl, we&amp;#39;ll call her Maria. She had her own apartment near the hostel, and would come over every now and then to do the night shift. Since some other coworkers and me always used to stay up late and there was mostly nothing to do, she often joined us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our regular customers who also stayed for a longer time at the hostel was the Terminator. Some dude from the islands in New Zealand, built like a brick. He seemed like a nice guy though for all I could tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During one night at about 03:00 am, a few minutes after we finished work, me and my roommate are smoking a joint while listening to some music. All of a sudden we hear a single, incredibly loud scream. The kind of scream that the antagonist always does in movies, do you know what I mean? No emotions in it at all, just pure craziness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very unpleasant to hear, and I immediately got up to go tell whoever it was to tone it down. We have other guests that are staying there too after all. But my roommate, a French guy who always had my back (shoutout, brother!), told me to give it a few minutes to see if it stops. I&amp;#39;ll call him Alex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did, for about an hour. Then again... this scream that seemed inhuman. By now, Alex also had enough and didn&amp;#39;t say a word when I got up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked down the stairs towards the patio, there was already a confused guest wondering what&amp;#39;s going on. Just as I ask him if he knows what all the commotion is about, Terminator shows up. I&amp;#39;ve been around and have seen some shit, but the look in this guy&amp;#39;s eyes is one of the scariest things I&amp;#39;ve ever seen in my life. This is what I can remember of the conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminator: &amp;quot;Nero9073! Oh Nero9073, I&amp;#39;m so glad I found you. Did you see him?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Uh, see who? What is going on?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminator: &amp;quot;Just tell me where he went.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;What are you talking about man? Where went who?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminator: &amp;quot;I KNOW you&amp;#39;ve seen him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, Alex has also arrived and is just as confused as everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Seen who!? You need to elaborate a bit if you want me to help you.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminator: &lt;em&gt;Puts hands on my shoulders&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;He JUST went past here. WHERE DID HE GO!?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I realize that something is wrong. The look in his eyes and the nonsense he was talking made it clear. Maria, who is on nightshift duty also shows up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Listen man, I have no idea what you&amp;#39;re talking about, and to be honest you&amp;#39;re freaking me out. Is everything okay?&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminator: &amp;quot;Oh no. He told you, right? Oh no. Oh no.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Calm down, we can sort this out. Just tell me what&amp;#39;s going on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminator: &lt;em&gt;Grabbing my shoulders harder and harder&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;TELL ME WHERE HE IS. I NEED TO KNOW.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex: &amp;quot;Ay man, not cool! Let go of him!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;grabbing his wrists, trying to restrain him a bit&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Calm down! I didn&amp;#39;t see anyone, only those of us who are standing here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terminator takes a look around and sees Maria, who is standing a few meters behind Alex, and goes completely crazy. He yanks his wrists out of my hands and runs straight at her. Luckily, Alex and the other guest manage to step in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Maria is frozen in shock and just stands there, puzzled. Alex and the guest are each holding him by an arm, while he still tries to run at Maria like a zombie. I get behind him, and put him in a chokehold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took three grown men to restrain the guy. I told Maria to go and call the cops, then lock herself into a room. Almost half the hostel is awake by now and his best friend (the guy who was traveling with him) finally was there to help, or better said, tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started talking to Terminator, and for a second it actually looked like he was calming down once he saw him, but it was a trick. Once his friend convinced us that he was calm enough for me to not choke him anymore, he pulled himself free and bolted across the hostel looking for Maria. His friend and the rest of us are in hot pursuit, and once he hears the cops he jumps over a fence onto the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t get very far, there was probably like half a dozen cop cars, dogs and even more officers. We all stood there, watching the silhouette of him run across the street to the sound of barking, untill the dogs caught up and mauled him. He was arrested, still screaming like a lunatic. By the next day he had already left the hostel. Maria quit her job shortly after and moved somewhere else. I never got to know exactly what it was that made him act that way... but I recall Alex telling me, and I quote; &amp;quot;when he looked at Maria who was standing behind me, it was as if he looked straight through me. Like an animal laying eyes on it&amp;#39;s prey&amp;quot;. Our guess was Ice.&lt;/p&gt;

She's mid-50's. Doesn't have a job because her mom is a millionaire and basically pays her and her siblings an allowance. She's in here 5-7 days a week, sometimes for up to 6 hours, dumping money into the lotto machines. She probably spends thousands of dollars a day. She has a few other bars in the neighborhood and cycles between them.

She's crazy. Clearly has a personality disorder. Bitches constantly and treats the other customers and the bartender as her therapist. Talks mad shit about everything and everyone. She's a quiet racist/homophobe, even though the main day bartender is black and this is Portland, FFS. (Ex: she's bitched multiple times about how she can't put rainbow stuff up in her yard because she thinks that it will make her look ""gay."")

Up until recently, she's been annoying and harmless. And she spends soooooooo much money here. But a month ago, she overheard a joking exchange between my lead line cook and a bartender and she flipped out. Bartender had asked for a side of ranch, line cook called her a ""needy bitch."" It was 100% friendly and none of her business. They laughed and she lost her shit, saying that nobody should talk to another person that way and blah blah blah blah. Line cook tried to apologize and say that it wasn't directed at her, but... like I said... she's crazy. 

This lead line cook is my Sous chef's husband.

So, after this incident she starts telling all the regulars that line cook is white trash and she's afraid to order food because she thinks that we'll poison it. None of us are happy with it, but since all this keeps happening when we're SUPER busy, we've tried to keep it under wraps to avoid causing a scene. Meanwhile, she still comes in, orders food to go, and then lets it sit there for hours while she gambles. 

Finally, today she comes in when the owner is doing paperwork and tries to talk shit to him and he just lays it all out. In the calmest, most rational way possible. She loses her shit and is crying and telling him that we're all lying to him. Yeah. We're all lying but she's trustworthy. At one point she says, ""I thought you were more of a man than this."" I don't jump in because I know that Tim being calm and quiet is going to piss her off more than any of us ripping her apart will, but I am *livid*. I've known my boss for over 20 years. He's awesome.

Anyway, she leaves out the emergency exit, slamming the door and causing a scene. 

Here's the weird thing: we thought we'd all be relieved, and we are, but I'm left with this really sad feeling. I think we might be one of the last places that she goes and she has no one. Lots of money, but no *one*. I can't believe she hasn't gotten a DUI yet. And if she's willing to talk shit about us while in the restaurant, she's probably not going to hesitate to lie about us online or to other bars. I'm hoping that most people can see her crazy, but still. I'm torn between relief and sadness for her.

Money can't buy happiness. Or community.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve had the place for 6 years, and we have a regular. She&amp;#39;s mid-50&amp;#39;s. Doesn&amp;#39;t have a job because her mom is a millionaire and basically pays her and her siblings an allowance. She&amp;#39;s in here 5-7 days a week, sometimes for up to 6 hours, dumping money into the lotto machines. She probably spends thousands of dollars a day. She has a few other bars in the neighborhood and cycles between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s crazy. Clearly has a personality disorder. Bitches constantly and treats the other customers and the bartender as her therapist. Talks mad shit about everything and everyone. She&amp;#39;s a quiet racist/homophobe, even though the main day bartender is black and this is Portland, FFS. (Ex: she&amp;#39;s bitched multiple times about how she can&amp;#39;t put rainbow stuff up in her yard because she thinks that it will make her look &amp;quot;gay.&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until recently, she&amp;#39;s been annoying and harmless. And she spends soooooooo much money here. But a month ago, she overheard a joking exchange between my lead line cook and a bartender and she flipped out. Bartender had asked for a side of ranch, line cook called her a &amp;quot;needy bitch.&amp;quot; It was 100% friendly and none of her business. They laughed and she lost her shit, saying that nobody should talk to another person that way and blah blah blah blah. Line cook tried to apologize and say that it wasn&amp;#39;t directed at her, but... like I said... she&amp;#39;s crazy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lead line cook is my Sous chef&amp;#39;s husband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after this incident she starts telling all the regulars that line cook is white trash and she&amp;#39;s afraid to order food because she thinks that we&amp;#39;ll poison it. None of us are happy with it, but since all this keeps happening when we&amp;#39;re SUPER busy, we&amp;#39;ve tried to keep it under wraps to avoid causing a scene. Meanwhile, she still comes in, orders food to go, and then lets it sit there for hours while she gambles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, today she comes in when the owner is doing paperwork and tries to talk shit to him and he just lays it all out. In the calmest, most rational way possible. She loses her shit and is crying and telling him that we&amp;#39;re all lying to him. Yeah. We&amp;#39;re all lying but she&amp;#39;s trustworthy. At one point she says, &amp;quot;I thought you were more of a man than this.&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t jump in because I know that Tim being calm and quiet is going to piss her off more than any of us ripping her apart will, but I am &lt;em&gt;livid&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve known my boss for over 20 years. He&amp;#39;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, she leaves out the emergency exit, slamming the door and causing a scene. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the weird thing: we thought we&amp;#39;d all be relieved, and we are, but I&amp;#39;m left with this really sad feeling. I think we might be one of the last places that she goes and she has no one. Lots of money, but no &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;. I can&amp;#39;t believe she hasn&amp;#39;t gotten a DUI yet.

So I'll keep this one short as I can, but since I've started working at a liquor store I've started meeting a particular brand of people. And these are the ones who insist they are of age, but do not have any verifiable I'd on them. 

Since I don't feel like twiddling my feet amidst the word of law, if you come in without a Walker or grey hair, I will card you. So in comes this one couple who look about that age, which means I'm asking for I'd. The man presents his but the woman stands adamant by his side. I ask for hers again (also since she was the one who held the bottle up to the register) and the man questions as to why even though he's paying. 

Our banter goes back and forth through the appropriate paces that follows this type of situation.

""But I'm the one paying.""

""I need to see both your id's.""

""I have a picture on my phone.""

""Ma'am I need to see the actual I'd to be able to sell this to you.""

""Can't she just leave and wait in the car?""

""No sir I have you both on camera. I need both Id's.""

It's at this point the woman is obviously annoyed that she cannot traipse off with her ten dollar bottle of moscato barefoot wine and walks off. This happens more then it should, and I'll reiterate to all those who go to a liquor store, please bring I'd, and if your caught with your pants down no I'm not giving this to you and getting fined. 

So politely, please piss off.

I work in a late night bar, but we have a kitchen that's rented out by a separate company. Its really casual, the menu is simple but it's great food. The head chef is the owner of that company but hes been on holiday for a week leaving the other chef in charge. I mostly work in the afternoon/evening, and it can be really quiet, so i usually offer table service for anyone ordering food, whereas they can also order and pay upfront at the bar. 

We had a booking for 14 people at 7pm on Friday for a hen party, written as a drinks reservation for which we took a deposit (we dont take them for food tables as its the kitchens responsibility). They turned up 45 minutes early, but we were quiet so no problem , and instantly assumed we would give them table service, so i said to my coworker that she could if she wanted, but i wouldnt (i dont mind waiting on tables but shes an excellent server and enjoys being a waitress and big tables make me really nervous so i tend to stay on the bar when i work with her). She went and took a food order, around £155 worth, and put the cheque through. They ordered all their drinks at the bar and paid cash. The chef was a bit overwhelmed but i was told that stuff would just come out as it was ready. Main meals started to come out, and everything seemed fine with the table. Food was coming up every 15 minutes, and the table started to ask where certain things were, so i just said 'it'll be on the way'.

Not really sure how but all of a sudden it seemed to have escalated. They complained to my coworker and made her cry, so she went to try and sort the issue. Every time i ran food to the table, they had more complaints, so i said i would go to the kitchen when one of my coworkers returned as i couldnt leave the bar. The hen refused one of her dishes as she said she had already had her main and didnt want a starter. She followed me back to the bar to wait until i could speak to the chef, and started complaining that the mains came about before the starters, and that they ordered from the 'starter' section of the meal (we dont have a starter bit, we have a 'small plates' section, which i pointed out). She asked to speak to a manager, so i said we dont have one in till later, and she says 'you dont have a manager in? Ill wait to speak to them'. I also tried to explain that the kitchen and bar were run separately so i couldn't make promises on behalf of the kitchen. My coworker who took the order and another coworker (who isnt officially a manager but acts as one) come up from the kitchen, and i go back to serving other customers at the bar and waiting my tables. A few more bits of food come up, so i run them and the women happily accept it. At this point they've complained about their starters coming after mains (despite not telling their server they wanted it as starters instead of sides), about how the food is cold and salty and was sat on the side for ages (not true, i ran all the food as soon as it came up as I was getting anxious about their wait),  about the fact we had no manager (we never typically need one in the day as both of my coworkers have worked there for years and know their stuff and our boss trusts them), and about how they had booked a table for food in advance so we shouldve had more chefs (not true, we clarified with them it was drinks only and got a drinks deposit off them) 

A few minutes later, the chef comes up, and hes got about 9 women circling him shouting at him, hes a socially awkward guy and got upset, when one horrible shitty woman said 'you look like youre gonna cry, need a tissue?' sarcastically. This goes on for a while and hes visibly shaking and upset. At this point the women have all moved to the bar, and are giving shit to all of the staff. The horrible woman who was rude to the chef is telling me how the management is terrible and when i said there was a communication issue between the server and the table, and she said its much more than that and how that because i choose to work here im part of the problem. My coworker told me they came to the agreement to pay half the bill, and some of the women are counting it out on the side, when horrible woman says to me and my coworker 'you see this? Youre getting none of it, you don't deserve it'. Again i just walked away, i wasnt even really involved and id tried my best to be polite. Said woman also demanded our food licenses, and the personal phone number of the owner of the bar and the kitchen claiming she worked in 'health and safety in the NHS', like that mattered?? They would've walked out without paying if we hadnt taken a deposit, as they were scared we would charge that card (we can't even do that) 

One woman did apologise, saying that she knew it wasnt our fault and that some of the women had had a drink and to ignore them, which i did appreciate. The group also claimed that they would be staying all night (we're open till 3am as a nightclub), which is bullshit as we heard them say they were late for their next reservation, and they only had their table for a set time. They ate pretty much all their food, and multiple women said they liked it despite others saying it was bad. The real kicker is my coworker found the woman who booked the table on facebook, and she had posted that they had gotten a £75 police fine for walking out on a tab elsewhere!!

The whole thing really affected the chef, and he came into work the next day drunk, and then tried to walk out and near had a meltdown when i was about to take an order from a large table. Was a rough rough weekend all in all. The head chef  is back soon, and he is really horrible to the servers even though we dont work for him, especially when we make mistakes, even if they're easy to fix. He once shouted at me for asking for extra hot sauce for a customer and expecting it for free. I know full well when i go into work next he will ask me about it, and hes so nasty sometimes, so im not looking forward to it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First post on here, its super long so i apologise! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in a late night bar, but we have a kitchen that&amp;#39;s rented out by a separate company. Its really casual, the menu is simple but it&amp;#39;s great food. The head chef is the owner of that company but hes been on holiday for a week leaving the other chef in charge. I mostly work in the afternoon/evening, and it can be really quiet, so i usually offer table service for anyone ordering food, whereas they can also order and pay upfront at the bar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a booking for 14 people at 7pm on Friday for a hen party, written as a drinks reservation for which we took a deposit (we dont take them for food tables as its the kitchens responsibility). They turned up 45 minutes early, but we were quiet so no problem , and instantly assumed we would give them table service, so i said to my coworker that she could if she wanted, but i wouldnt (i dont mind waiting on tables but shes an excellent server and enjoys being a waitress and big tables make me really nervous so i tend to stay on the bar when i work with her). She went and took a food order, around £155 worth, and put the cheque through. They ordered all their drinks at the bar and paid cash. The chef was a bit overwhelmed but i was told that stuff would just come out as it was ready. Main meals started to come out, and everything seemed fine with the table. Food was coming up every 15 minutes, and the table started to ask where certain things were, so i just said &amp;#39;it&amp;#39;ll be on the way&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really sure how but all of a sudden it seemed to have escalated. They complained to my coworker and made her cry, so she went to try and sort the issue. Every time i ran food to the table, they had more complaints, so i said i would go to the kitchen when one of my coworkers returned as i couldnt leave the bar. The hen refused one of her dishes as she said she had already had her main and didnt want a starter. She followed me back to the bar to wait until i could speak to the chef, and started complaining that the mains came about before the starters, and that they ordered from the &amp;#39;starter&amp;#39; section of the meal (we dont have a starter bit, we have a &amp;#39;small plates&amp;#39; section, which i pointed out). She asked to speak to a manager, so i said we dont have one in till later, and she says &amp;#39;you dont have a manager in? Ill wait to speak to them&amp;#39;. I also tried to explain that the kitchen and bar were run separately so i couldn&amp;#39;t make promises on behalf of the kitchen. My coworker who took the order and another coworker (who isnt officially a manager but acts as one) come up from the kitchen, and i go back to serving other customers at the bar and waiting my tables. A few more bits of food come up, so i run them and the women happily accept it. At this point they&amp;#39;ve complained about their starters coming after mains (despite not telling their server they wanted it as starters instead of sides), about how the food is cold and salty and was sat on the side for ages (not true, i ran all the food as soon as it came up as I was getting anxious about their wait),  about the fact we had no manager (we never typically need one in the day as both of my coworkers have worked there for years and know their stuff and our boss trusts them), and about how they had booked a table for food in advance so we shouldve had more chefs (not true, we clarified with them it was drinks only and got a drinks deposit off them) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, the chef comes up, and hes got about 9 women circling him shouting at him, hes a socially awkward guy and got upset, when one horrible shitty woman said &amp;#39;you look like youre gonna cry, need a tissue?&amp;#39; sarcastically. This goes on for a while and hes visibly shaking and upset. At this point the women have all moved to the bar, and are giving shit to all of the staff. The horrible woman who was rude to the chef is telling me how the management is terrible and when i said there was a communication issue between the server and the table, and she said its much more than that and how that because i choose to work here im part of the problem. My coworker told me they came to the agreement to pay half the bill, and some of the women are counting it out on the side, when horrible woman says to me and my coworker &amp;#39;you see this? Youre getting none of it, you don&amp;#39;t deserve it&amp;#39;. Again i just walked away, i wasnt even really involved and id tried my best to be polite. Said woman also demanded our food licenses, and the personal phone number of the owner of the bar and the kitchen claiming she worked in &amp;#39;health and safety in the NHS&amp;#39;, like that mattered?? They would&amp;#39;ve walked out without paying if we hadnt taken a deposit, as they were scared we would charge that card (we can&amp;#39;t even do that) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One woman did apologise, saying that she knew it wasnt our fault and that some of the women had had a drink and to ignore them, which i did appreciate. The group also claimed that they would be staying all night (we&amp;#39;re open till 3am as a nightclub), which is bullshit as we heard them say they were late for their next reservation, and they only had their table for a set time. They ate pretty much all their food, and multiple women said they liked it despite others saying it was bad. The real kicker is my coworker found the woman who booked the table on facebook, and she had posted that they had gotten a £75 police fine for walking out on a tab elsewhere!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole thing really affected the chef, and he came into work the next day drunk, and then tried to walk out and near had a meltdown when i was about to take an order from a large table. Was a rough rough weekend all in all. The head chef  is back soon, and he is really horrible to the servers even though we dont work for him, especially when we make mistakes, even if they&amp;#39;re easy to fix. He once shouted at me for asking for extra hot sauce for a customer and expecting it for free. I know full well when i go into work next he will ask me about it, and hes so nasty sometimes, so im not looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

I just paused when I heard this customer say that, wondering how in the world they made it into high school. Granted after working in a restaurant I dislike high school kids for their attitude.

The only way I can justify it is she wanted the bottle of Seagrams when I let them know their order only came with a can of soda. So, when they said Ginger Ale, I have them both Canada Dry in the can.

Then I heard those fateful words.

When I was in my early 20's I worked at a breakfast joint across the street from a University that was having a stellar football season. Before the games we would get slammed so hard that our wait would be 2+ hours. There were 40 tables, 2 servers, 1 host and 1 bus/prep/dish. 

One family (man and woman with college aged boy and girl) was being really disruptive and rude to the hostess. The husband tried to sit at a dirty table and I told him he could either wait for the hostess or leave. Finally they get their table in my section. yaaaay. The obviously controlling father/husband  orders for everyone, slams a cup of hot coffee while giving me a finger to the face so I can immediately have the honor of refilling it. The family looks mortified.  I put in their food order and unsuccessfully try to forget about them.

He yells at me every 5 minutes about his food while I am flying around trying to get the other 20 tables done. I finally yell at him and asked him how fast he thinks the kitchen can possibly get the food out if he had to wait 2 hours just to sit. I was done with him and even my other tables were lamenting his behavior with me. His family stared at the table. 

When his food came out and his 6th coffee was refilled I was beyond elated. I was in the middle of a coffee run about 2 minutes later when the manly man yells 
""Are my eggs supposed yod be cold?!""

I walked past him when he has the audacity to grab my arm and pulled me so hard I almost fell backwards. I screamed ""What the FUCK!!"" Then slammed the burning hot coffee pot on his wrist. He throws his arm up and spills coffee on his chest, leaps out of his chair and starts to motion like he was going to attack when just about every guy jumped out of their chair. I ran into the back because I have PTSD. Through my anxiety attack I huffed enough air to share what happened with owner. He forced the man out and the wife to pay. The kids ran out with their father while he yelled ""Don't you dare fucking tip her!"" She didnt make eye contact; paid with a credit card then slipped a $20 and whispered ""Sorry."" Then went out never to be seen again. 

My other tables literally applauded me when I went back into the dining room and everyone tipped me a hearty amount.

So last night I get a 4 top, I immediately got the vibe they were semi-baller type individuals, got them started on top shelf old fashions, seafood tower, bottle of nice wine, kobe beef all the way around, beignets and port wine to top it off, the most ideal scenario which hasn&amp;#39;t happened to me literally ever in all my years working there. End of the night, these dudes are fucked up and happy, $1300 check, tipped $400.&lt;/p&gt;

This was about 3 years ago, when I was a senior in highschool and wanting to make money in order to get ready for college. It was my first ever job.

The job itself was pretty shitty: I had to stand between a hot grill and a hot press all day, it was super labor intensive, had shit hours and pay, etc. But the worse part of my job was my GM.

I don't know why, but from the moment I was hired this man decided he thought I was the scum of the Earth. Always told me I was working too slow, wasn't calling out food orders loud enough, yelling at me in front of customers, shit like that. All of my other coworkers hated this man as well, and two of them even cried after getting yelled at so badly. They would try their hardest to get on his good side, showing up early to work, working off the clock, but I never did either of these things because of my insanely busy schedule.

Now, I think of myself as a hard worker. At every other job I've had, I've been complimented on my work ethic. But this man thought I was the laziest piece of shit, and seemed every day to try to get me to walk out on my shift. And my senior year was already going fairly bad: my father had his second heart attack, my parents were talking about separating, and I was stressed about beginning college. And this was before I knew that you could call HR about work violations (read: I was a naïve teen who didn't understand labor laws). 

So one day I was working a night shift. We had had a fairly big rush, and a bus filled with cross country runners had come in about thirty minutes beforehand. My coworkers and I had worked our asses off on getting these people in and out of the store as quickly as possible, but were still falling behind. Meanwhile, my GM was sitting in the back with his thumb up his ass, occasionally coming out of the office to yell at us to work faster. 

At the end of the rush, he pulled me into the back in front of all the chefs and threatened to ""fucking murder me"" because ""he had never seen someone work so goddamn slow in his entire life."" Afterwards, he slammed his hand on the counter next to me, yelled at me to start working, and slammed his office door shut. One of the chefs who I was friends with came over to check up on me. He was this tough military guy, and even he looked shaken over the encounter.

A week later, I got written up for missing a day of work after I came down with a nasty case of the flu, and refused to risk customer health and come in sick. They told me if I missed another day for the next three months, I would be terminated. I handed in my two weeks the next day, and was immediately taken off the schedule. 

Looking back at it, I wish I had called HR on my GM the first week I was there. He made my semester an absolute living hell, and I was happy to hear that he left the restarunt a year ago and now it's under wayyyy better management. 

But anyways, fuck that GM and I hope he never abuses a worker like that again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I used to work at one of those restraunts where you start at one end, order your food and see it made in front of you.

Definitely a town hall worker by the ID peaking out of his chest pocket. A man that makes good money but leaves no tips. He, in fact, left no tip.

He ordered our most expensive Spanish ham sandwich, a double espresso and some candy to get rid of the bitter taste in his mouth. While his order was being made, he greeted my sister. Autistic, non-verbal... but the ultimate sweetheart. An angel on Earth. I took her to work today because we're going through a rough patch at home and she looks miserable when I leave her alone. We only have eachother.

As mentioned, she doesn't talk. So to his greeting, she waved shyly. No eye-contact, but a small smile. He asked for her name and that's when I answered ""She can't speak because of a disability. She does use sign language, sir.""

The most awkward pause followed. His sandwich arrived. He took a big bite out of it, and with his mouth still full, he uttered ""Such a pretty girl and the Lord made her a retard.

""No, we're half Korean. Born and raised here, though.""

I said nothing else back. My sister looked down. But I couldn't snap since I pay the bills with this job. Let alone in front of her, she'd bawl her eyes out. Pat her head lovingly. She fidgeted with a paper straw, trying to distract herself.

The gentleman gave her his small bag of candy. Said something along the lines of ""Since she has the brain of a kid, might as well eat like a kid, right?""

No, sir. She doesn't have the brain of a kid. Her brain has high functionality. She enrolled in college this year.

She knows you just called her 'retarded'. She'll cry about it at night. I'll be telling her that your opinion doesn't matter.

And by the way, when you paid with a folded 10€ bill, you accidentally gave me two. I kept the second one.

You know, for candy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone came to the bar I work in. Dressed up, cigar hanging from his mouth, umbrella in hand although it has not rained in 3 months, cologned that was at least 60% alcohol. Definitely a town hall worker by the ID peaking out of his chest pocket. A man that makes good money but leaves no tips. He, in fact, left no tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ordered our most expensive Spanish ham sandwich, a double espresso and some candy to get rid of the bitter taste in his mouth. While his order was being made, he greeted my sister. Autistic, non-verbal... but the ultimate sweetheart. An angel on Earth. I took her to work today because we&amp;#39;re going through a rough patch at home and she looks miserable when I leave her alone. We only have eachother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, she doesn&amp;#39;t talk. So to his greeting, she waved shyly. No eye-contact, but a small smile. He asked for her name and that&amp;#39;s when I answered &amp;quot;She can&amp;#39;t speak because of a disability. She does use sign language, sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most awkward pause followed. His sandwich arrived. He took a big bite out of it, and with his mouth still full, he uttered &amp;quot;Such a pretty girl and the Lord made her a retard. You got a handful in your hands if you&amp;#39;re the one taking care of her. What a pity, her face is so gorgeous. Chinese? Are you two Chinese? Did you come from China?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Merriment ensued!

Tonight I was called in 2.5 hours early because of a concert taking place a few blocks down the road. I helped my fellow server rock through the last few hours of dinner with only one complaint that ended up being about “cold food” despite steam coming off the plate when I threw it away (but that’s a different story). Around 7:15 pm everyone left and the restaurant was nearly empty because of the big draw in town. think of a band whose biggest hit is the name of a continent.  

10pm rolls around and I’m bartending by myself.  The kitchen has just closed; but plenty of concert goers are feeling rather hungry. I do my best to make these folks happy with fried food so the kitchen folk can head home. In the midst of all this a couple walks in. I ask if they intend to eat and they decline my offer. THANK GOD, because I was getting my butt kicked between slinging drinks and avoiding burnt food. 

They both get a Busch light; one draft and one bottle. Fast forward a few minutes and they recognize my hard work, asking how I was doing. I say I’m doing pretty well though I am a bit tired because I had to come in a bit early because of the oddly scheduled Sunday concert. They tell me about how that’s where they just came from and how they left early to avoid the crowds on the way out. Such a pleasant couple in the middle of the chaos.

Little did I know the chaos had barely begun. Fast forward to about 11:45 and I hear a clunking sound followed by a “where did my ring just go!?!” I walk over to the couple and ask how things are going they say “well... we think our engagement ring is behind the bar”. Folks had started to clear out and the bar was almost entirely my Sunday night regulars so I offered to help them find it. She said it flew off her finger while she was imitating a piano solo from the concert.  Well, my initial search didn’t yield any positive results and they ask if they can come look behind the bar.

Any other time I’d have said no way, no customers can cross that line but I could tell they were distraught and thought to myself “well at least they know what this darned ring looks like” plus I was starting to neglect the other customers so I needed time to catch up. 

Suddenly I turn around and all of my well bottles are on the bartop. They are scooping ice out of my ice bin with their bare hands. Backup liquor bottles are strewn across the bar and two of my trashcans have found their way outside to our patio with the trash in centralized piles. I don’t know where this couple thought their ring got to but they were committed to finding it. I see some of my initial ideas of where the ring could have ended up also positioned away from their original locations and figure this couple had thoroughly looked through everything.

1 am rolls around and I begin regretting allowing this couple free reign to locate this ring. I even begin to question if the ring ever existed. The bar was in disrepair and I desperately wanted to avoid staying til  4am to clean up a mess I didn’t create. The couple ran out of steam and wanted phone numbers to call so they could come back before open and tear the place apart. I give them the business number and they give me their cell phone number and call a cab so they can get some rest at their hotel room.

Their cab shows up quickly and they are gone. I started talking to some fellow industry workers and asked what they thought of the whole mess. Mostly they felt bad about the tremendous mess this couple left in their wake but also they tried to joke about the situation. One of my favorite customers was sitting right next to the energetic air pianist whose ring flung off and feared that she would be accused of stealing their ring. I had given up. I was thoroughly convinced the ring never existed; the couple just wanted to act out a little bit and happened to be decent actors.

Despite my beliefs I began to nervously adjust the individually wrapped toothpicks we have in a rocks glass behind the bar. I hear a clunk. I look down. It’s the ******* engagement ring. 5 different people had looked in this glass for the ring and it never was noticed. I called the number they left behind and realized the man’s 3s and 5s looked oddly similar so it took a few tries to put it all together. 

They grabbed a cab back to the bar. Bought a drink for all my regulars and tipped far too much for me just doing the  morally right thing. I guess I just have one suggestion through all this; make sure to have your ring fitted and sized so it doesn’t fall off at the bar and lead to mass chaos/destruction.

And this has been my TedTalk.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR A couple lost their engagement  ring; gave up on finding it, left for their hotel and I found it 6 inches in front of where the original incident took place. Merriment ensued!&lt;/p&gt;

He came with his friend who he had originally met on his homestay in university. He let me know they were friends of his family so they weren't a REAL homestay to him.

He asked for an (ethnicity of our restaurant) server. I am the token white girl there. I have been there 6 years and have picked up quite a bit of the language and the (from that country)servers here regularly ask me to clarify things from the menu. So I ask him to try me and if I don't get it I'll get someone else. 

He asks for a very simple dish then asks a few other things testing me. I do it with flying colours obvs.

Then he asks me if I only work here or if I go to school. I yes I'm at (Y) university but I'm just on a break to work and save money. He starts to rant....

I started at (Y) but I transferred to (X) because people were too liberal there.

They have another branch in (my actual hometown) where people at (X) university aren't so liberal.

I interjected I started at (X) but transferred to (Y) at the advice on my professor since (X) does not have my program.

Oh BIG mistake he says. X is so much better blah blah. Started to quiz me on professors he knows at Y.

Oh this professor at Y and I are FRIENDS I have his number and I am an Air Canada pilot now and I give him flights etc etc.

Me:ok cool..I gotta...

Him: WHY are you on break? At least you don't have loans I guess you've been here six years

Me: well, I DO have loans but don't want to take any more out ...but you know rent etc 

Him: oh (laughs) I wouldn't know about that I'm one of those rich Asian kids who has never had to pay rent.

Me : ok I'm gonna go get you your drink (it was a lot longer he was almost manic raving and I tried to interrupt like 3 times to leave and he just kept talking over/at me)

I brought his drink while he was in the bathroom and on my tables I heard such gems as :

Women from Russia are hot but they just want money (his table mate who looked like he regretted the meetup was from Russia)

I'm not racist BUT..(didn't hear the end of that one)

I cleared their plates and got their cheques and gave them to tetsu our amazing bartender to take payment cause I just didn't want to deal.  He told tetsu he didn't want his receipt because he ""was just too busy"" while his friend was still waiting to pay.

His friend tipped and he didn't. I had him pegged as a non tipper as soon as he started ranting about how he is too conservative to consort with liberals lol. Not even mad just don't wanna see his face again and pretty sure his silent head hanging friend will reconsider the next dinner.

Tonight at work, another server (B) whose section was next to mine had customers in all their booths. We had no host and were seating ourselves. B saw that some people had walked into our restaraunt and went to seat themselves, but the customers wanted a booth, so B sat them in my booth and said to me in the kitchen 'I'm getting their drinks' so I replied 'okay what did they get? And I'll come take their order' to which B replied 'I'm taking them' so I gave B a look as if to say 'that's not right' as she walked out of the kitchen. Then after dropping off their drinks B reiterated '*I'm taking them*'  and I said 'I heard you' in an aggressive way back to them. I was really upset by how entitled B was acting and went back into the kitchen where I ran into our manager and said 'B just sat herself in my booth, what can I do? Can I tell her to fucking not do that next time?'and my manager said 'yeah,  do you want me to say anything?' And I replied 'no it's fine'. Well, my manager told B not to do it again,  and next B walks into the kitchen with some dishes and goes to put them by the washer while repeatedly yelling 'you're a fucking snitch you had to go tell our manager?' and I (stupidly) said 'sorry I was angry and actually asked her not to say anything'. And for the rest of the night every time I was around B she would talk to others with their back turned to me loudly announcing 'don't say that too loud someone might hear you and snitch on you' 'people keep going to the manager around here'. B even talked about it to an old employee at the bar loudly enough so that I could hear them half way across the restaraunt.  I didn't say a single thing back to B after that but I didn't avoid them and even looked at them, waiting for B to actually look me in the face and say something *to* me about it. After the table B stole from me left, B left it dirty with dishes piled up and I was not about to clean it for them so it stayed like that for a couple of hours. Eventually the same manager from before asked me to bus it and I replied 'it's B's table'. The manager actually headed over themselves to start bussing the table and I followed saying 'well if you're going to do it I'll help you' to which they replied 'I don't want to cause more trouble' we headed into the kitchen and they asked B to bus that table. B went and got some stuff from the table and came back into the kitchen in a huff saying 'no one wants to help anyone out around here' (definitely pointed at me).

Soon after I asked my manager if we could cut some people because business was slow.

As soon as B was clocked out and I thought she had left I started yelling in the kitchen 'thank f***ing God that bitch is gone'. It was truly relieving until I walked out of the kitchen.  As if it wasn't bad enough having to work with B, B hung around and got a drink at the bar after work, sitting close to the kitchen entrance.

Im not sure if she heard me but, didn&amp;#39;t hear anymore comments from her after that. Hopefully B wont act like a pathetic child the next time I have to work with them, but if they do, I am so upset I might not hold my tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

All the times I have left jobs before have been because of moving or going back to school. I've put up with way too much shit in the past and I'm not putting myself through it again.

Recently returned to school and started working at a ""fast casual"" restaurant, i.e. you take the customer's orders up front at a cash register but still bring them their food, check up on them, and bus their tables. The last restaurant I worked at was chronically understaffed but this place has plenty of staff, is just poorly run. We're constantly out of basic shit (cups, straws, napkins, etc.) and are, apparently, one unlabeled sanitizer bucket away from the health department permanently shutting us down.

Anyway, I wasn't scheduled to come in this morning, but last night as I was leaving a shift manager told me that she really needed me to come in this morning because people had called off and the Sunday lunch rush is always wild. I figure that hours=dollars so sure, let's get some money. I show up at 11 this morning, clock in, and have the general manager come over and tell me to immediately clock out because they were over on labor. I asked if that meant I should go home and she said that no, I was just supposed to sit there until they needed me.

So there I was, on what was supposed to be a morning off, sitting at work off the clock for 45 minutes not being allowed to leave. Now, the night before, a baby bird had died on the sidewalk right next to where people receive their drive through orders and no-one wanted to pick it up. Normally, I under no circumstances do any work off of the clock, but I'd had to clean up dead animals at past jobs and I was tired of the drama, so I threw some gloves on and took care of it. My manager saw this, and to show how grateful she was, gave me an expired, hard as a rock cookie for my troubles.

Eventually I'm needed for work so I spring into action, take care of the lunch rush with no issue, and start to clean off tables when it slows down. Instead of doing that, the manager yells at me to start working on my side-work list. Okay, whatever, I'll do it.

A few minutes later I'm waiting for a co-worker to refill the sanitizer buckets so I can wipe down what I'm supposed to, and standing next to the side-work list reading what else I had to do (it changes day to day) when I hear a way too familiar voice behind me.

*""Hey! Do your list!""*

""I am, I'm just waiting on some sanitizer water.""

""You can wait on the sanitizer water, but you still have to do your list!""

There were customers just feet away, so instead of arguing in front of them, I just drop it and keep going.

One of the things I was supposed to do was refill the napkin holders on the table but, as I had mentioned before, we had been out of replacement napkins for the past week or so. So, as I walk back behind the counter I ask, ""hey, did we get new napkins in yet?""

""I'm going to let you figure that out for yourself.""

Okay, holy hell that's a rude way to respond, but again there's guests right there so I'm just going to not say anything and drop it, but then she follows it up with:

""Did you hear what I just said?""

Now, as I mentioned before, I've had to pick up dead animals on the job, dealt with a horribly understaffed restaurant and rude coworkers and stuck with it all, I'm not a quitter. But the combination of a complete wreck this morning was followed up with getting belittled over asking an honest, reasonable question, and I'm out of here, especially not putting up with that for $9.25 an hour.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To preface this: I&amp;#39;m 22 and have never quit a job before in my life.

Normally, I under no circumstances do any work off of the clock, but I&amp;#39;d had to clean up dead animals at past jobs and I was tired of the drama, so I threw some gloves on and took care of it. My manager saw this, and to show how grateful she was, gave me an expired, hard as a rock cookie for my troubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I&amp;#39;m needed for work so I spring into action, take care of the lunch rush with no issue, and start to clean off tables when it slows down. Instead of doing that, the manager yells at me to start working on my side-work list. Okay, whatever, I&amp;#39;ll do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later I&amp;#39;m waiting for a co-worker to refill the sanitizer buckets so I can wipe down what I&amp;#39;m supposed to, and standing next to the side-work list reading what else I had to do (it changes day to day) when I hear a way too familiar voice behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hey! Do your list!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am, I&amp;#39;m just waiting on some sanitizer water.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can wait on the sanitizer water, but you still have to do your list!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were customers just feet away, so instead of arguing in front of them, I just drop it and keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I was supposed to do was refill the napkin holders on the table but, as I had mentioned before, we had been out of replacement napkins for the past week or so. So, as I walk back behind the counter I ask, &amp;quot;hey, did we get new napkins in yet?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to let you figure that out for yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, holy hell that&amp;#39;s a rude way to respond, but again there&amp;#39;s guests right there so I&amp;#39;m just going to not say anything and drop it, but then she follows it up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did you hear what I just said?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as I mentioned before, I&amp;#39;ve had to pick up dead animals on the job, dealt with a horribly understaffed restaurant and rude coworkers and stuck with it all, I&amp;#39;m not a quitter. But the combination of a complete wreck this morning was followed up with getting belittled over asking an honest, reasonable question, and I&amp;#39;m out of here, especially not putting up with that for $9.25 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

For background we are a burger/wing/ribs joint currently under semi new management from one of our sister stores. We have two big fryers for fries and wings. We then have two mini fryers for cheesebombs, veggie patties and chicken strips.

We have a cashiers desk where the cashiers take uber orders and take away orders. The only way to get to this desk is to walk through the bar and then the line (open kitchen), which is heavily trafficked. This is also where the main computer is. We use iPads for the server’s POS. We also have order sheets which is why we don’t have little notebooks on us.

Tuesday: Put in new POS system. Doesn’t work, waiters can barely get their tips that night because the cashup is basically non existent. 

Wednesday: We use the pen and paper system to keep log of everything sold. Handwritten kitchen tickets, handwritten bills. At 15:00 we have a working POS system. Breaker on the fryer breaks down. We fix it with duct tape.

Thursday: majority of the day, everything is fine. 

Now where this story begins. 

Friday: Friday morning goes fine. Shops opens at 10:00 everything is going fine. 11:00 our tablets go offline which means we punch everything on the cashdesk computer. It’s all chill since there’s not a lot of customers because of the Rugby. Guy comes in and fixes the tablets. GREAT!! Everything runs smoothly from 15:00. Until the fryer breaks down again at 16:00 and we can’t get the breaker to stay up. My GM drives to our sister store to get their mini fryer. Great!! 

17:00: Going steady. Tables are starting to pick up a lot.

18:00 Mini fryers trip the power due to being overheated and I believe also some oil spillage on the broken cables. Wifi gets reset, computer goes off, tablets are no longer connected anymore. 

18:15: They try and keep the fryers working.

18:45: No fried foods sold. No tablets. Semi-full shop. About 6 uber drivers waiting for food. About 15 tables have no idea of what’s going on. 

19:00: I have explained to my tables that I can’t serve fried food. Both decide to only pay for their drinks and leave. Understandable. I switch over to pen and paper, the rest decide to keep on running to the cashdesk to punch food. Big mistake.

19:30: Still tables that have decided to stay. Uber drivers are now up to 13. All of them rudely yelling at the cashiers. Take away customers have been waiting almost an hour and no update, no food (this is a mistake in the cashier’s part). 

19:45: They start calling Uber customers and explaining. Luckily only 3 cancelled their order.

That night we had too many walkouts to count. Our voids were R1000 (about $100) and R1200 ($120) in “comped” orders. We lost around 20 tables because of that.

BUT WAIT THERES MORE!!!!

Saturday team of servers have no idea of what happened. Only me and one server from Friday work on Saturdays. So Saturday morning we set up the shop and around 10 minutes before open we were told that we’re closing the shop until all the techs have been here. So we spend the day cleaning and catching up on admin and such because the mall requires us to have our doors open for a set amount of time. 

14:00 our “area manager” (aka new semi-management) makes the call the open the store without the techs having been there yet. He does warn us. He does tell us. Nothing. He just says that we have to let the customers sit and order. Luckily the techs came at around 14:30 and by 15:15 everything was semi running smoothly. I then also put my dog down at 16:30 and came back to work while the guy with the POS system was still trying to fix shit which was hella funny.

Today was probably the smoothest day since our old Operator/GM left and since the new POS has been installed. Let’s just hope it stays this way.

TL;DR: The fryers broke down and our POS for the servers specifically was offline which forced us to turn away customers and cost the owner of the shop around R45000 ($4500) due to the lack of sales on the weekend.

I was working one busy Friday night about 2 weeks ago and collecting glasses from our outside beer garden when all of a sudden I hear a guy pronounce very loudly to his pals ""and that's the most expensive wank I've ever had"" at this point I've already made it round to where they were sitting and hear this.

So I go up to him and ask ""did I hear that right?"" Trying not to laugh and all his mates start howling with laughter. They all ask me to sit down to hear this story and this guy explains.

He was out in our capital once and he really wanted sex so he went up to two hookers and asked how much it would be to have sex with them and they were like how much have you got. He explained he only had around £150 and they said that wasn't enough for sex but for £100 they would make out with each other while he could watch and wank. He agreed. I thought, that isn't that bad! You know, guys have their needs I guess. But it turns out the story wasn't over. The cherry on the cake was that it turned out that he has a foot fetish and he had asked these girls if he could finish on their feet. They agreed for extra £60! 

So this poor bloke spent £160 to watch two girls make out and wank on their feet... This story honestly scarred me because he was like acting it out and everything while telling me in grave detail.

I thought, that isn&amp;#39;t that bad! You know, guys have their needs I guess. But it turns out the story wasn&amp;#39;t over. The cherry on the cake was that it turned out that he has a foot fetish and he had asked these girls if he could finish on their feet. They agreed for extra £60! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this poor bloke spent £160 to watch two girls make out and wank on their feet... This story honestly scarred me because he was like acting it out and everything while telling me in grave detail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safe to say I will never let curiosity get the better of me. Some things are best left untold 😂&lt;/p&gt;

I honestly loved the work, but I can't imagine doing it now! It's a tough job but can be very rewarding at times, as was this case.
I was working for a large chain restaurant that is known for their home cooking and had been a server there for a few months at this point. I ended up working there for almost 5 years and it  was the best server job I ever had!
On Christmas Eve we opened early, about 6 am, I think, but we're only open until 12pm. My shift started at 8 am and I would be there until noon. Christmas Eve is hugely busy at this place and there is a line out the door! I have five tables sat within minutes..all 3-4 tops. Needless to say, I was running my butt off but everyone seemed happy so I was confident I was keeping up.
My tables started to leave and I was preparing for round two when my table of 3, father, mother daughter about 8 years old called me over.
The father said he wanted to give a Christmas gift to someone. I was so busy and in the zone, I thought he wanted me to take something to another table or give it to someone else, maybe he didn't want them to know it was from him..this has happened before, where a table would anonymously pay for someone else's meal. So I said, ""Sure, who should I give to?""
He laughed and said
""No, we want to give a gift to someone. We do this every year. We see someone who we feel could use a gift, and we see how busy you've been and you've taken great care of us this whole time! So that person is you..Merry Christmas!!""
He handed me a $50 tip on a $22-$23 check! They had only had beverages and very light meals so they were an easy table.
I had been having some financial issues that year and that money helped my Christmas more than they knew! So thank you to that sweet family who helped make my son's Christmas a little better that year!

And, I know this sounds almost too sweet and with timing too perfect to be true, but I promise it really happened about 15 years ago to me.
It's what I always think of when I get fed up with how some people treat each other. It helps me to remember, that there are genuinely nice people in the world!

when i start greeting people in french who don’t speak it, even if they don’t want to interrupt me to ask for english, they’ll put on a very obvious “sorry i don’t understand” face and i’ll start again in english with a smile

on to the comparatively short story from today: 

before we got busy, i sat and couple who came in, held up two fingers and asked for “deux”. i got them settled and (in french) let them know we took orders at the counter. in response i got a smile and a nod 

when i ended up walking past their table again about 15 minutes later i was informed (unreasonably angrily in my opinion, 15 minutes is not incredibly long) that they were ready to order and had been waiting for me. i apologised for the wait, and let them know that we usually have customers order at the counter 

her: well you should have told me that! that i wouldn’t have been sitting here waiting. you’re only making your own life difficult 

me: i’m sorry. i usually let customers know as i sit them, but it must have slipped my mind. one of those days i guess haha 

(trying to lighten the mood did not work and was met with a stink eye)

me: well what can i get you guys? 

the rest of the actual meal went smoothly, but i was informed again as they paid that they should have been told. 

MATE. IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY TO YOU THAN JUST ASK 
i don’t stand beside tables for 20 seconds spewing information and ending with “okay?” just for a laugh. i’m trying to help us all out here 

it happened similarly recently where a couple struggled through what french they knew (100% props for trying, mad respect, good on you for trying to speak the language of yhe country you’re in), got themselves a table, i let them know they ordered at the counter. as i was leaving i caught a whispered
“what did she say?”
“ i don’t know”

&lt;p&gt;me: well what can i get you guys? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the rest of the actual meal went smoothly, but i was informed again as they paid that they should have been told. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MATE. IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY TO YOU THAN JUST ASK 
i don’t stand beside tables for 20 seconds spewing information and ending with “okay?” just for a laugh. i’m trying to help us all out here &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it happened similarly recently where a couple struggled through what french they knew (100% props for trying, mad respect, good on you for trying to speak the language of yhe country you’re in), got themselves a table, i let them know they ordered at the counter. as i was leaving i caught a whispered
“what did she say?”
“ i don’t know” 
so i did end up repeating myself in english haha &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i can’t read people’s mind, no matter what that online degree claimed it would teach me, so please just tell me&lt;/p&gt;

**Blueberry Smash**

Last year, I was working at OTPH on Mother’s Day, and as expected it was slammed. I’m not sure why people think an ale house with 90 beers on tap, a limited menu, and absolutely no brunch specials is a great place to take their grandma, but apparently many did. Surprisingly, most of my tables were very easy and pleasant, with one major exception…

Now, I should start by explaining that we had a drink on our seasonal cocktail menu called a Blackberry Smash-you’ve probably heard of them, it’s essentially whiskey with muddled blackberries. They are good if you like whiskey, but the alcohol taste is very strong. I often had to explain this to ditzy girls who would ask if they should get disgustingly sugary sweet cocktail #1 or disgustingly sweet sugary cocktail #2 before trying to settle on the blackberry smash. It was infinitely easier when people would ask me how it was first, so that I could explain. Despite all of this, this drink was regularly sent back.

Anyway, I had a large table on Mother’s Day of an entire family-grandparents, parents, cousins, aunts, uncles, and a bunch of kids all dressed in their Sunday best. They were all pretty nice and easygoing except for one mom, who had a bitchy scowl on her face before I could even greet them. It was obvious that she felt this was “her day” due to her ability to squeeze out children, and she also seemed jealous of the grandma in the group for stealing her thunder.

Anyway, when it came time for them to order drinks, she asked me about our blackberry smash.

Me- “I like it, but it is VERY heavy on the whiskey flavor, so you’d really have to enjoy whiskey to like it.”

Her-“Oh, great I love whiskey, I’ll have that!” Her husband side eyed her as if to say *Bitch, I’ve literally never seen you drink whiskey in the 15 years we’ve been married.*

So, I took the rest of the drink orders and rang in her blackberry smash. As the bartender was reading the ticket, she called me over to say that we were out of blackberries and she couldn’t make it. Great. I went back to the table to apologize and get a different order.

Me-“I’m very sorry, miss, but we are actually out of blackberries. I should have told you earlier, but I didn’t realize we were out. Is there a different drink I can bring you?”

Her-“You’re OUT of blackberries?? On Mother’s Day??!!” *Yes, because if there’s one food that says “Mother’s Day” it’s blackberries?*

Me-“Unfortunately, yes, we’ve been very busy. May I offer you something else?”

Her-“Well, you have blueberries in the restaurant, right? Or are you out of those too?” Sarcastic smirk.

Me-“We don’t carry blueberries in the bar for any of our drinks, but-“

Her-“I saw them go by on that salad, you have them. Make me a blueberry smash.”

Me- (trying to talk her out of it)”Yes, you’re right we do use blueberries on our kale salad, but the blackberry smash has a very specific flavor. It won’t taste the same with blueberries, and I really don’t think you’d like it.”

Her-(fuming) “It’s not your job to tell me what I will and won’t like. You really shouldn’t say things like that to customers.” *Mother’s Day brunch and server training in one day? How did I get so lucky?*

Me-“Of course, ma’am *(yeah, now I’m calling you ma’am instead of miss to make you feel old).* I will get you a blueberry smash.

I went into the kitchen and explained my dilemma (angrily) and they gave me a little cup of blueberries to bring to the bar. I explained again to the bartender about the blueberry smash lady and she looked at me like I was insane.

Bartender-“It’s not gonna be good, it won’t taste the same at all.”

Me-“I know. I’m aware, but this lady is a bitch. Sorry, can you just make it? She’ll probably send it back, but I just want to be done with it.”

She shrugged and made it and it looked like purple vomit in a rocks glass.

I brought it to the bitchy lady, she smiled smugly and took a sip. She IMMEDIATELY made a hideously unattractive, puckered up face, put her hand up dramatically and pushed the drink away.

Her-“That’s terrible! You are selling drinks that bad to paying customers?”

Me- (no longer giving a fuck) “Well, ma’am, we don’t actually serve this drink. We serve a blackberry smash that we are out of. You wanted a blueberry smash, and I did warn you that it wouldn’t be good.”

Shockingly, she didn’t throw a fit, probably because she knew she was wrong. She pushed it away and ordered a glass of chardonnay. All of that for a fucking glass of chardonnay.

When I brought it back to the bartender she said, “Let me guess, she didn’t like it.” 

Me-“Nope, but I feel like she won’t give me anymore trouble about it.”

The rest of the meal went pretty smoothly. She modified the shit out her salad and complained that it was too small, but otherwise it was fine and the table tipped me 20%.

I’ve made the suggestion to management to add a blueberry smash to the menu just to fuck with difficult customers, but unfortunately, they didn’t like the idea.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copying and pasting from a while ago so bear with me...      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me; [company] rose the price, yes, they&amp;#39;re 6.99 now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asshole; You&amp;#39;re kidding me!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me (done with shit today); Do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asshole; I will! I&amp;#39;m going to call the cops if you don&amp;#39;t give me a five dollar pizza!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me; Do it, then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asshole; I-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me; Good night, sir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then proceeded to hang up, and made my way outside to where my manager was doing trash. I relayed to her what happened, and I surprisingly didn&amp;#39;t get in trouble for telling the guy to go ahead and call the cops. She told me she would have said the same thing, lmao &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t call back while I was there, nor did a bunch of squad cars show up demanding I give this man a five dollar pizza. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have paid to hear &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; phone call.&lt;/p&gt;

I work at &lt;insert big chain movie theater&gt; as a concessionist. I ring people up for popcorn, drinks, etc. and also get them their food. 

Here's one policy (that I'm sure all of you are familiar with or have something similar at your work) is that *once the customer has touched the food/emptied it from it's container*, we can no longer take it back for a refund. I.E., if I hand you a popcorn, but if you haven't touched it yet and say you want more butter on it I can get it for you. But if you empty it into a bag I can't take it back.

This is important to know *because* I had this lady come in with like, 5 relatives of hers. She only orders 1 popcorn. Our movie theater does this thing where we'll give a refill of popcorn on an empty one so long as it's a large popcorn, so lots of people will order a large, dump it on a tray or into a bag, then ask for a refill to get two for one essentially.

This lady pays for her food, dumps the 1 popcorn she bought onto 3 trays for her family, then asks for a refill. I go get it to her. She then tries it and says ""ewww this is tooo salty. Try it"" (hands it over to her family) ""Isn't this salty?"" (Relative nods in agreement).

So, to be nice, I go get her a completely *different* tubs worth of popcorn without counting it as a refill so she can get more later. When I hand it to her, I thought I fixed the problem. I thought I was being generous.

This is what she says to me instead. 

""You know &gt;: ( You could have offered to exchanged it. BUT you didn't &gt;:( So I guess I'm not getting any good popcorn."" And then she walks off before I can reply.

I was kind of stunned and feeling hurt, because those kinds of comments make me feel stupid. So, I politely asked each guest in line after her if they would try the popcorn to make sure that it wasn't too salty and if it was I'd get them another one.

*No other guess complained about it.* They all said it was fine.

I went back to see what that change was and it was $1 on a $35 and a $1 on $11. Ok annoying but no biggy, I still had $300 left on the tab to divide up. I ran the rest of the cards, returned them to everyone and wished the happy couple an amazing wedding.

When everyone scurried out so quickly I knew I was about to be disappointed. Everyone left at least something EXCEPT the couple, who I bought two desserts for.

On Monday, while waiting to do his cash out he goes to another server and asks “where is the faggot ass Chris (closing manager for the night) at?” Chris is gay, too. Said other server then tells the GM about what the new server said but “don’t tell Josh I told you because then he’ll know I ratted on him”. So now GM doesn’t want to speak with Josh about his homophobia against Chris (and also me who is a server and anyone else in the restaurant who is gay). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now the GM doesn’t walk to talk to Josh or anything. Am I wrong to think that the GM should talk to josh about his comments? I had to work with Josh in a section together on Tuesday and it was very awkward because I know he is probably talking behind my back and I can’t be polite knowing he doesn’t like the gays. He also asked another sever if there were a lot of gay people that work there, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think he should be fired. Its now almost is a hostile work environment. I know the store owner would stand up for me and Chris and anyone else, but even now he’s just letting it slide and that he and the GM will keep an ear out if he says anything like that again. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, I work in a little restaurant that's attached to a bar. 

Both the bar and the restaurant are a bit of a dive tbh, and the restaurant is consistently slow during my shifts ( tues/wedn/sun 4-10pm). most shifts I'm lucky if I get over 3 tables and $15-20 dollars is my usual take-home pay. the most I've ever taken home in tips is maybe $50. I do get a decent hourly wage as well so it's not like i""m hurting for money, but this is honestly the slowest restaurant I've ever worked at. 

I've held down different positions in different restaurants so I have a pretty good idea of how the business works. This place does no advertising, no coupons, customers are usually regulars or live in the immediate area and just stumble upon it. They have live music/karaoke almost every night, but don't do anything to let people know! I live in a college town with a major college campus, and this place could be pulling in a lot more if they put the effort in! They've got great food, great workers, great drinks, etc. and it's just wasted. 

I do really adore the place, but I've been wrestling with the idea of moving on to a busier restaurant.  I like food service bc of the fast pace and no lie, 75% of my shift I'm sitting on my phone bc there is absolutely nothing for me to do. I just feel like I could be doing a lot more, and making more money in fewer hours. 

But, on the other hand, this is my first serving job, and the reason that it's been such an easy transition was bc of the slow pace. Am I really ready to deal with more customers, more staff, and a bigger kitchen? Serving is also a second job for me, and I worry that in moving to another restaurant I might overextend myself and it could affect my performance at my primary job.

This happened tonight, and I’m still upset about it and I was hoping you could offer some advice, similar stories, support, or if you think I was in the wrong, that’s fine too. Let me know. Anyway. 

Tonight was crazy at my TGICHILIBEES. At the time that this couple came in (we will call them the O’Douls douchebags), I had a constant stream of 7-8 tables, mostly big tops, and they came in waves all at the same time. I saw this couple sit in my section, and I went over and greeted them like I always greet my tables. They looked at me weird, but gave me their drink order. I came back with their drinks, set them down, and asked if they needed another minute.  I noticed that the man was just finishing up signing up for our rewards program. 

Just for some context, the place I work for offers a rewards program. If you sign up, you can either get free chips or a non-alcoholic beverage each time you visit. NA beverages are limited to tea, fountain drinks, and lemonades. This is what follows: 

O’Douls Douchebag: For my non-alcoholic beverage I would like an O’Douls.  (I thought he was kidding so I may have smiled a tiny bit, but nothing rude at all. I quickly realized he was serious). 

Me: I’m so sorry, but the offer only includes fountain drinks, teas, and lemonades. Did you want to get the chips instead, since I see you looking at our meal deal? 

OD: No, I’m going to get a drink and the chips included in the meal deal, so that was a giant waste of time. 

Me: I’m sorry. You could order a different appetizer with your meal deal, and get the chips for free? 

OD: No. We need another minute. And please send over your manager. 

Me: sure, he will be right out. 

At this point I assumed they were going to bitch to the manager about not getting the free stuff they wanted, so I sent the manager over. He was there for a while, and when he came back into the kitchen, I asked him what was up. He told me that someone else would be taking the table. I asked why, and if I had done something wrong. I basically had to pry this out of him because the manager didn’t want to tell me, but he ended up saying that the couple said I had rudely interrupted them, and they wanted a different server. They also told the manager “I will have my nonalcoholic beverage now, and I want the O’Douls”. Luckily the manager didn’t budge on this. I was super upset, but I just ended up moving on with my night. I didn’t get in any trouble, the manager said it wasn’t a big deal. 

That being said, and maybe I’m wrong, but my job is to come and get your order. Not stand there while you finish gossiping. If you are talking, find a good place to put your convo on hold. I don’t have the time to stand there and wait, and YOU should be the one to stop chatting and order, that’s not on me. I have seven other tables that need my attention. I was very polite, I didn’t even notice that I had presumably interrupted. I don’t feel like I did anything wrong, but I’m upset and I can’t stop thinking about it. I have never had an issue like this before. I am ranked in the top three for service scores at my store. I average 10% above the expected server attentiveness and satisfaction scores. I have won service champion of the month three out of the last six months. I have been a sever for over three years, and have never had anyone complain about me like that. Ever. I have lots of regulars, and people compliment me regularly. I didn’t treat this table any differently than any other table. 

So was it me? Did I do something wrong? Were they just dicks? Do you guys stand there and fucking wait for them to decide to finish a convo? I do say excuse me or sorry for interrupting when I feel it’s necessary. I didn’t say that to them, I didn’t notice they were talking since I had just walked around the corner. Basically....what the fuck? I care about my job, and I care about my customers. Maybe that’s why I’m hurt. I just thought THEY were rude as all get out, and they shouldn’t have acted like that. It just has me second guessing myself, and wondering if I somehow was in the wrong here. What do you guys think about having to interrupt someone? Because I see that as a necessary part of my job. If you want to get good service, I’m going to have to walk up and engage you at some point.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys.

From what I got from the reports, it's where a restaurant takes part of the commission of the sale of food (not the tip) and gives that to the server. They take a percentage from that amount for the server is give it to non-serving staff.

It was a bit confusing in the report that so hoping for some clarification on what tipping out is and entails.

EDIT: Here is the best answer and explanation for anyone else who is wondering about the practice. https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/ddf52w/what_exactly_is_tipping_out_and_why_is_it_bad_for/f2u0dpg/","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in America and never heard of this term until recently after watching some Canadian new reports on minimum wage increases.&lt;/p&gt;

Me: would you like a receipt?

Customer: yes.

Me: *stupidly not doing it myself, believing that he can do it* alright, would you like it printed, texted, or emailed?

Customer: *no answer, looks at the screen for a good minute, before hitting the “done” button*

Now I played stupid, I don’t know if it made him feel bad but his attitude only got worse.

Me: Oh, did you not want a receipt?

Customer: no! I wanted it printed.

They've been hiring rapidly in preparation for the takeover.

Part of me wants to believe that the new owner fired the old staff so as to prevent insubordination, since the new staff would have only known him as an owner, not a fellow server once upon a time.

It was still a bummer as I've only worked there for 3 months. Just wanted to vent a little.

So, I promise to you all that this really did happen, although it is totally disgusting. It still seems unreal when I think about it now. I was a waitress at two different restaurants from 1996-2004, while in HS and college. The first restaurant I worked for was a small family owned business ran by a husband and wife. I worked there from 1996\~2000. The way the place was set up was that people could walk in and seat themselves, at which time servers would bring menus, take orders, serve meals, etc.  We were also similar to an ice cream counter because we had 20 flavors of hand-dipped ice cream, as well as soft serve, and if ppl didn’t want to eat a meal they could just come in for a shake, sundae or cone (think hand dipped shakes, sundae toppings, banana splits, etc.). So, in addition to serving tables who had come to sit and eat a meal, we had to cover the ice cream counter.

One year, most likely 1997 I believe, the owner (let’s call her Sally) decided she would close down for a few weeks to do some remodeling. She was always cheap and trying to cut costs, so the first day we opened back up after the remodel, Sally scheduled just herself and me to work. That day she cooked and washed dishes (she rarely ever left the kitchen in general), and I covered all tables in the restaurant (\~11 tables, ranging from 2-5 tops), and covered the ice cream counter. Naturally, because we were understaffed, we ended up being swamped all afternoon, and it was all I could do to keep up. During this time I had a husband and wife come in and sit at a two top. The man ordered a hand-dipped chocolate malt, and I was hustling like mad to keep everyone fed and happy. As I began making his chocolate malt, I realized that we had run out of chocolate syrup. AHHHH!  So my 16 yo self made a quick decision to substitute hot fudge for the chocolate syrup in order to keep moving quickly and hopefully keep everyone happy. I scooped the ice cream into the metal cup, added some milk, and went over to the hot fudge hot well, which was a metal container in a water filled hot well, covered with a plastic lid that had a small notch cut in it to accommodate the ladle (translate: lid was never sealed to container tightly). I was rushing like mad, scooped it all in, put it up under the mixer, poured most of it into the old-fashioned clear shake glasses, added whipped cream &amp; cherry, and then delivered it to the table, along with the remaining malt left in the metal container with long spoon, which was how we did it. 

Chocolate malt successfully delivered, I hustled on to the next customers’ needs and wants. A few minutes later the man’s wife came up to me at the cash register, grasping something small between her thumb and pointer finger, demanding, “Do you know what this is?!?!?”  I was so young and busy, had no idea what she could be talking about, so was thinking to myself, “Bitch, this better be good, because I don’t have time for this shit!” But I wasn’t expecting what she said next. She said, “This is a mouse leg, and my husband sucked it up the straw of his chocolate malt!!”  She was freaking out and very loud, and I was dumbfounded and wasn’t sure if she was crazy or what. The owner, Sally, soon heard this woman making a commotion at the register and came out of the kitchen to see what that ranting was about. So the customer stated again to Sally that her husband had sucked a mouse leg up his straw. The next thing I know wife and Sally are yelling, and Sally says, “I need to see this in more light.”  So she snatched it from between the woman’s fingers, walked through the kitchen and out the back door into the sunlight, wife following the entire way.  As soon as Sally got outside she said to the wife dismissively, “This is just a cherry stem!”, and promptly threw it in the weeds beyond the very small paved parking, never to be found again. Wife promptly freaked out, barged back through the kitchen, into the dining room, yelling the entire time about the mouse leg and that she would be calling the cops, and hustled out of the restaurant with her hubby.

This left me dumbfounded, no longer in sync and unable to remember what I was doing or what my other tables needed because it was such a commotion…AND now I had the entire restaurant looking at me like, “What the hell just happened?!?” Talk about uncomfortable.

Trying to make sense of what had happened, I quietly ran the situation through my head and remembered that I had used hot fudge rather than chocolate syrup to make the malt. So, very discreetly, I peeked into the hot fudge well, and gave it a stir with the ladle.  Sure enough, there was a mouse carcass in the hot fudge. The plastic lid must have been slightly askew during the remodel, allowing the mouse to fall in and then slowly simmer for a week like tender meat in a crock pot. Therefore, when I was rushing to scoop hot fudge into the metal container to make the malt, I must’ve managed to also scoop up just one of the mouse’s little tender drumsticks, which was so well cooked that it was like a tender roast where the meat just falls from the bones. EEWWW! OMG!! The wife was right!! It WAS a MOUSE LEG and the husband did suck it into his MOUTH!! Not a cherry stem as the owner had alleged! 

I couldn’t believe this was happening. Almost in shock, I went to the kitchen and told Sally the situation. She of course (quietly) freaked out and promptly took the hot well full of hot fudge to the dumpster and poured it all out. True to her word, the wife had called the cops, and before too long two of them showed up to investigate the situation. By then the leg was lost in a sea of untamed weeds behind the paved parking lot, and the remaining carcass, along with the hot fudge, was buried in the dumpster behind the restaurant. The two officers did a quick look around the restaurant, finding nothing, meaning Sally and I were off the hook that day. But I will never, ever forget that I served a chocolate malt to a man which contained a tender mouse drumstick that he promptly managed to suck up his straw into his MOUTH!! Puke!!

It has been at least 20 years now, so I suppose it’s safe to come clean and tell my Reddit peeps, that yes, I once served a man a very tender mouse drumstick as a bonus in his chocolate malt. With almost ten year of serving experience, this was the most disgusting thing that I ever saw.

TL;DR Summary:

As a 16 yo waitress I made a man a chocolate malt with hand-dipped vanilla ice cream and hot fudge, which ended up containing a tender mouse leg (drumstick) after a mouse had fallen in the hot fudge hot-well, and simmered until the meat fell from the bones, therefore easily allowing me to unknowingly scoop it up into the malt in my haste.  Customer (husband) then sucked said tender drumstick up his straw into his mouth, and his wife (rightfully so) freaked out, made a huge scene, and sent the cops, who found nothing by the time restaurant owner and I had removed all evidence of the three-legged mouse carcass.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One time user name because this story, although 100% true, is so seriously f&amp;#39;ed up.&lt;/p&gt;

I work in a small restaurant that has an apartment beneath it. The new family living there is, uh, less than ideal. I've had lots of trouble with them assuming they get to eat for free since they live below us (we are not their landlord, and not associated with them at all, so no, they cannot eat for free). They've gotten food promising to pay later and never had, come up to use our washroom when theirs was occupied, asked to borrow entire rolls of toilet paper because they're too lazy to shop, never tip, etc. 

So anyway, it's a slow rainy evening so I'm enjoying a little break with a coffee and a bowl of soup when our front door swings open with great force. I immediately jump up ready to deal with whatever fresh hell is upon me, when I see a familiar face. It's the father from downstairs. 

Before I can greet him, he speaks in a panicked voice. I notice his hands are shaking and he looks legitimately upset. 

""I need a lighter!"" He says. ""Do you have a lighter I can borrow?! It's an EMERGENCY!"" 

I don't smoke, so I went to the kitchen and took one of our big lighters for lighting the grill and ran it to him all the while wondering what he could possibly need it for. I figured there must be a problem in his apartment. Maybe? It didn't make sense to me, but as I said, he seemed visibly upset. 

He hasn't even come into the restaurant, he's half in half out the door letting all the cold Canadian air in. I hand him the lighter expecting him to run downstairs (and wondering if we'd ever get it back). But nope. I shit you not, he takes the giant kitchen lighter and... Lights. A. Joint. 

Still half inside the restaurant. 

I mean, pots legal here now and I'm all for it but really? Emergency? And lighting up inside my restaurant? GTFO.

Nothing too interesting.

This specific night we closed at 18.00. The reason was that the bar was rented for a private party. I spend all afternoon hanging up decorations in preparation and the regulars all knew the last round would be at 17.45 to all be out at 19.30 when the party was to start.

As 18.15 hit and everyone was finishing their last beers and getting ready to move out as another regular came in that wasn't there earlier that night. Let's call him Anthony. 

Anthony was a first class asshole and from a mile away you could see how many beers he already had as with every beer he would lift his arms more until he was spread eagle (yeah, it was fucking weird). Anyway, Anthony was about half way up and made his way to the bar, ripped up the paper stating the notification about the private party and sat at the bar to order a drink.

I told him no, we have a private party and everybody needs to leave the premises because its rented out. 

He told me no, I am a regular and I am going to be drinking beer here tonight. I shook my head and politely told him that I was sorry, but we couldn't do that tonight. Tomorrow we were open for business and he was more than welcome.

I guess his previous beer kicked in because he got a little bit closer to eagle mode and started screaming at me that he solely was keeping the place open (uhh, yeah sure). I told him that if he was prepared to put down 5K for the night, so we could move the party elsewhere he could stay there, no problem. We'd figure it out. Well, 5K was more than his monthly tab so that was ridiculous (duh, that's why we were willing to close the bar for such evenings, it was a LOT of money in one go).

Anthony wasn't happy with this so he got up and started ripping the decorations of the wall. At this point I knew there was only one last resort and I was either going to be punched in the face, or things were going to end up okay. So I ran up to him, put my hand on his shoulder and turned him around.

Then in a very stern voice I told him. Listen Anthony, you're turning 50 years old and it is your big party. The only night that is special for you. How would YOU feel if someone tried to ruin it for you? It was as if I switch turned and he started apologising, went straight for the door and I didn't see him anymore that night. I managed to fix the decorations and no one was the wiser.

That day I learned: If you make a drunkard feel consious about himself he'll fuck off. Something I've used many - MANY times since that event.

The party was great and seeing I've met my in laws during that party I got something out of it too ;)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked in a small bar, mostly regulars, you were always working alone. Nothing too interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

Good News!  
I spoke to the GM-equivalent fellow, who is honestly one of the best supervisors I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Being the fellow who interviewed and hired me, he's fully aware of my motivations and reasoning for working at the restaurant, as well as the time I'm willing to put into it.  
When I spoke to him about the schedule, he told me flat out to ignore all but 5 of my shifts that week (he picked the five, but shit, that's more than reasonable).   
He even was willing to give me a glowing recommendation if I felt the need to branch out in my 'career', as well as suggesting a nearby bistro that he's close friends with the GM if the hostilities with the Scheduling Manager end up chafing any further.  
As I stated before, I absolutely don't want to leave. It's not about the money it's about getting out of the house to rub shoulders with age peers, to do a service-job that I truly love, and to interact with people from walks of life other than my own on a reliably regular basis. Plus the idea of a grown-ass man asking for a 'petty allowance' from his husband strikes me as genuinely absurd, so making a bit of immediately-available-that-night cash on the side is a plus.  


As for the concerns about the wages and paycheques, I had a rather long conversation with Awesome GM Guy about how the various paystub maths and taxes work, and he explained it to me in great detail. I took what he spoke to me about to a friend who does tax law and it was confirmed legit, so I feel very much put at ease that there's nothing sketchy going on there- I simply didn't understand a few key aspects of the equation, and now I do.  
Everything is above board, and even somewhat generously compliant given the minimum for servers in our region.    
(min wage is 2.13 plus tips, to be compensated to 7.25 if tips aren't covering the end-of-the-week total..... Except this specific restaurant stops counting tips when tipped-hours end, so if I work 5 hrs, but 1 of those hours is after I cash out my last table and I spend the rest of the time doing back-work, then that one hour is paid 7.25 and my tips only count towards the prior 4- which is NOT the norm in this city)

Then, they have the AUDACITY to ask if they can get it comped since their meal wasn’t how it was supposed to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be one thing if I hadn’t tried multiple times to get them a fresh plate made, but I honestly asked them FOR SURE 3 times and they declined every single time. And if it was “so bad” why was there nothing left? Not even a single crumb? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My manager went out there and explained to them that we wouldn’t be doing that since they finished their meal even after being asked if there was anything we could do to fix it for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly cannot stand people who just complain to get stuff for free. Get out of my face &amp;amp; get out of this restaurant. Don’t come back, please.&lt;/p&gt;

We have a lovely alfresco and playground area that is VERY popular pretty much anytime school is out and the weather's nice. (And given this is Perth, Australia, the weather is nice A LOT. We're basically Greece with less humidity. And a stong economy.) As it starts to warm up again, I'm reminded of all the families begging us to squeeze them in despite it being fully booked out. One particular family comes to mind from early December last year. 

Playground area is fully booked at 2:45. Family begs to be squeezed in for 'half an hour and one round of drinks, max'. I speak to my manager and check the bookings sheet - the latest booking is for 430, so I tell them that, and that they'll have to be out no later than 4pm. They reiyterate the one drink, half an hour thing.

Naturally, they start ordering food as soon as they sit down and have littered the table with multiple rounds of drinks and platters of food over the next hour. I remind them at 3:45 that I'll be needing the table to reset by 4 (especially since the table is filthy and requires more than a simple wipe and clearing a few glasses). They look peeved at me for interrupting them and inform me of how much food they still have left but, fine, they'll be out by 4 if it's such an inconvenience. 

Of course, 4 comes and goes and they're not out. They tell me they'll leave when the table is required. And of course, the first of the 430 booking arrive at 410 and are not happy to have people sitting at the table and the table a mess. The first table leave at that point, complaining I'd promised they could stay til 430. A) I said 4, that the booking was for 430 and B) I highly doubt they would have been ready to leave at 430, either. 

I really don't like doubling up on tables like that, especially in the playground as it tends to attract families who don't want to leave until everyone is ready - the kids have finished playing and the adults have finished chilling. And of course, we can't just tell such parties that we don't double up on tables because no-one trusts them to leave at the agreed upon time.

I work at a restaurant/bar that specializes mainly in craft beer/whiskey. We only have two locations and pride ourselves on quality food and personable service. 

We have a regular who comes in, usually with friends, who happens to be a writer for a popular tv show. The guy is fantastic, personable, and always tips well. I’ve served him multiple times and always walked away happy with the experience. 

Last weekend he came in about 30 min before the kitchen closed with his wife and two friends I had never met. They ended up staying for more than a few drinks and a bunch of food. 

Since they were one of my last tables and regulars, I chatted with them for a while. With the new friends I discussed the local craft beer scenes of our cities and gave a bunch of bar and brewery recommendations. We got along famously. I gave them a bunch of free samples of beer and a free dessert for their regular patronage. It was the most fun I had talking with a table in a while. 

Fast forward to 30 minutes after close, they are still there. I’m working on closing and the friend comes up to me to settle the bill before I bring the check to the table. Sweet, makes my life easy. I run his card and give him the copy to sign and continue closing. They head out and I go to pick up the check. He left a 10% tip on a $250 bill. I could not believe my eyes. 

I have never been so pissed at work in my life. I went up to my manager and asked if I should say something to the regular next time about his friend being a prick. Everyone told me it was in my best interest to forget about it.

I don't like tipping for it being arbitrary and often disconnected from service quality.

So what I wanted to ask:
Is there a short and polite way to notify a waiter that I want as little attention as possible not because I dislike him/her and want to stiff her? And is ""large party service fee"" adequate percentage for a tip?

We're open Monday to Saturday, 12-2 and then 5.30-9.

Friday and Saturdays are busy all year round with locals but in summer, daaaaamn we were busy. I worked on a bar last summer so it was a different kind of busy. I'm not sure which I prefer honestly. But anyway, it's a Friday night. We have 14 tables, and we have two sittings. We have and Early/Pre-Theatre Menu and then we have a Dinner/A La Carte. So at weekends and busy weekdays we have resets, meaning that one table might empty but we still need it again soon.

This particular Friday, we had four resets which is actually pretty good for us. Usually it's eight or nine, but we were short staffed and we had a function of like 22 or something in our downstairs function room so our manager decided to keep out restaurant numbers down a little. 7.30 rolls around, we had three of our four resets left to come in, and in walks this fucking bat.

""I called earlier today to book a table but was told you were fully booked. However I've just walked past your window and I can see you have two empty tables.""

It had been a pretty rough night as it was with people being pricks, so I was kind of at my wits end. I kind of muttered something along the lines of ""we have an hour and a half left of service, we have tables still to come in. we are definitely fully booked tonight I'm afraid.""

Not a single table was empty at 9 o'clock when we closed, so really lady, there was no room for you. If you were told on the phone that we were full, then dammit we're fucking full. Why would we lie? This is the shut that pays our wages.

Fucking people, sometimes.

EDIT: I've mentioned this in the comments but I should have put it here in the first place; although the way she said it might not seem so bad here, but it was her tone and how she ended up actually calling my boss and the owner of the resteraunt a liar for telling her we were full. In the end, even if we have tables left it's his call whether we're full or not. Whether it be to do with staff or whatever, it's his business. And he is not the kind of guy who'd decides one night, ""I feel like a quiet one, we're full"" when there's still tables available.

We often have people come in and say things like this, especially early on when not all our tables have come in yet. I don't understand why people don't realise that the place is our livelihood? Every table that we have is a potential extra tip (not that we work just for tips here, our wage is decent) and for our owner even more so, that's extra money for him why would he turn it away?

This woman continued to argue with me that there were empty tables and she and her husband would like to eat, she asked to see my manager who lucky fucking me was at a table at the time so I had to tell her he was busy with another customer at the moment but she was welcome to sit and wait if she liked.

Ok, so no cheese? ""Yeaaa, cheese is ok. Just today"" I'll tell the cooks to not butter your toast? ""Oh, it's fine""

Whyyyyy.. why even bother saying you're vegan? I don't care! I literally do not care. However, I am going to let them know that we do need a veg breakfast meat for ya'll. That we can do. Prob not getting tofu scramble any time soon.

Eta: I understand what a vegan is. I was vegan for years back in the day. If someone is ordering am omelet, I'm going to assume they want eggs and question the dairy. For me, dairy was the kicker. I know nobody and nobody's mom cares, but eggs aren't dairy. Still not vegan. Just sayin.

We have both Spanish and English but the English once are sometimes harder to find. I came up to them and greeted them in english as I instantly realized they were not locals. They asked me for a English card.

As I was going through the stack of menus I heard them speaking polish. I instantly smiled but kept on looking. When I finally found it I handed it over to the guy closest to me and said in polish to him ¨There you go. Sorry we don´t have a Polish card yet¨ The group looked at me with a smile but the guy just said ¨no problem¨ and didn´t realize on the beggining I spoke polish to him. 

He asked me in English what I recommend while the rest of the group looked at him like some kind of loco (crazy). I once again answered in Polish. Then it finally clicked. He looked up and asked me if I just spoke polish to him. I said no and all of his friends burst in laughter.

They ordered our best burgers and while they were expecting the food I finished my shift and went to the tables outside and have my lunch. They suddendly come out to me and ask if they may sit with me. They seem nice so I said for sure. We started talking had a few beers and left a big tip for all of us.

Yesterday evening took an unpleasant turn when a disgruntled man, looked to be about mid-30s, came in. Let's just call him Guy/guy for the rest of the post. Ordered a bowl of beef noodle soup and when sis brought it to him he'a glaring at her all the while, I'm behind the counter starting to get peeved at him doing so.

Night goes on and while he's still acting miserable things seem okay. Chatter among the church group is mostly with regards to scripture, bible passages, that they had gone over during worship.

I'm still behind the counter just doing the usual stuff, and then all of a sudden the guy sitting alone with his soup goes off on them.

Not sure what set him off, was screaming about how yheir faith in god was stupid and that they were a bunch of idiot sheep for following a religion that people have used as reason for committing heinous acts throughout history.

That was around the time when Ma chimed in. She gets his attention, ""Excuse me! Can I ask what religion you practice?"" He goes on to say he's an atheist, keeps talking about how faith is stupid, and a way people lie to feel better about empty lives they live. She then responds with ""If that's how you feel, fine, no problem. But just because you feel that way about religion doesn't mean you can bully other people who do feel it gives them purpose and feel that it is meaningful and good for them."" 

Guy goes on to ask ""What good has this bullshit faith done?! People just used it to force people to think how they want them to without question!"" Ma shoots him down with a few words.

""You mean like what you're trying to do now?""

Guy has no answer to that, just has this look on his face like a kid who had his sandcastle ruined by the tide. Slams his spoon on the table and leaves.

Store's quite for the next few seconds. Then the church group start thanking Ma for sticking up for them like that, old lady comes up and hugs her saying she's so grateful that she stood up for them like that. Ma says to think nothing of it. Group all pitch in and leave a big tip, way more than necessary, Ma says that's alright but they insist.

For a bit of backstory (though this is a short story), I am and have been a barista for around 3 years. It has taken me a while to get the hang of latte art but it is now a skill that I pride myself on. I do my best to put art on every possible drink.

I once prepared a latte for a customer I had not served before or since, but when he saw the little leaf I put on his latte, his face lit up. “It’s *almost* like you’re a professional barista!” He squealed with delight. I smiled and wished him a nice day, but boy, was I dumbfounded. 

I think about this nearly every day, and I’m still not sure what part about it all made it seem like I’m not a professional. I was literally at my JOB, where I WORK! Whatever the reason, he left me with a story that amuses me each time I get to tell it.

I've been going there for trivia since before I got the job there (trivia since January, working there since July) with mostly the same group of guys (and occasionally someone's gf).

Even before I started working there, they would hook us up a bit, but now that I've started working there I get 50% my food and drinks, and my friends all get 50% off just their drinks. Yesterday, a friend of a couple guys on our team, who's played with us once before, came to play. He ordered the most food, so he volunteered to pay.

I might not have said it directly to him, because he didn't hear me and tipped $22.

I got up to use the restroom and checked what he left our bartender and I was kind of rude when I saw. I told him that we received a huge discount because I work there, and that tipping like that would be a great way to get my coworkers to resent me and make sure that the rest of our team no longer gets their drinks half-priced (they're applying an industry discount but none of those guys are industry). He apologized and said that he just did 20% like he always did (pre-tax I guess). I was kind of angry and snapped at him that he should always tip before any discounts are applied. He ended up leaving $40, which I thought was still a little low but I wasn't gonna argue at that point.

I just kinda felt like an asshole for looking at the check and for snapping at this guy, even though I think he's incredibly annoying and pissed me off all night before that.

Most couples are extremely chill, cool with our industrial/rustic vibe, have a great time and the reception is a huge success. Easypeasy.

Saturdays bride however.... called at lease 3x a week asking for favors outside of the things we would generally handle/allow (asking us to make arrangements for drop off times with vendors, move very heavy wine barrels, take large art off the wall, let her block fire exits, etc.). I want her to have her perfect day so I help and accommodate when possible (not the fire exit obvs).

Day of comes around, I arrive earlier then usual to let them in so they can start setting up and they all just stand there looking at me waiting to be told what to do. Bridezilla never told them how she wanted things set up! They ended up face timing her while she was getting her hair done and she walked them through each thing (lots of yelling). Annoying but still fine, everything got set up and the place looked amazing. 

We all thought we were ready but then she noticed they sent the wrong chairs. The rental company couldn't swap them out in time so another company was called and they brought some rickety, scratched up things but they were the right color so in they come. 

Guests start arriving an hour early, no big deal. We get drinks going, everyone is happy.

DJ comes to set up, forgot a table. No big deal, I find him one.

Taco people come, set up, leave. No problems until the bride and groom come and there is no food left for them! Apparently the taco people were supposed to be there the entire event to replenish the buffet. Bridezilla calls them up, more yelling. 

A second taco company is called, they come out and everyone else gets fed. Come to find out later that there was more trays of taco supplies in the fridge from the first company that never got brought out. They apparently let ""some girl"" know. 

Sodas for the guests are also still in the fridge, never got brought out. No bucket or place to put them or I would of just done it.

Instead of a cake they opted for stacked wheels of cheese. Super cute and delicious. Came in pieces, no instructions. Mom almost started crying at this point. She wins allstar of the day, couldn't of pulled this off without her!

Speech time comes around and I notice that the groom is holding a Coors. We are a small craft brewery so this is not only illegal, its straight up offensive! I am not a monster though so I wait until after the speeches to pull him aside. I take the beer and remind him that he is breaking the law and we wont allow any more outside booze.

He apologized, said it wont happen again, we move on. 

At this point I have been working for over 12 hours, the party is nearly over and everything seems under control. I do a last check in with my staff, they are good, I go home. 

The next morning I wake up to a message from bridezilla asking me to call her. She starts with her long laundry list of complaints and asks to meet with me since she (among other things) believes she was charged incorrectly.

I come in to meet with her ON MY FIRST DAY OFF IN 9 DAYS. She is 1 hour late, no apology. Starts to tell me all her complaints again and says some more lies about my staff. I wait until she finishes then remind her that we are not her wedding planners, we serve beer and give you a room for your party. 

I also bring up that she actually left one bill unpaid (about $400) and that as stated in the contract I should of shut the whole party down as soon as the groom brought a Coors into the building. 

We chat some more, the groom apologizes more. They pay and leave. Finally.

Next day the first chair vendor comes to pick up the chairs that were the wrong color and notices the napkins that came with the rental are missing. Asks me to call the bride and ask where they are. I say fuck that, nope. She leaves. I would bet money that she never calls for those napkins.

Just so you know, lady, hardly anyone else knows about proper cutlery etiquette, so I can't avoid clearing their dishes if they don't know.

So one of my coworkers, let's call him Jim, is one of those know it all servers who loves to correct people when they're wrong and suck up to management. He actually used to be one of my managers at a previous restaurant but now he's just a bartender/server, although he still often gets into his power trip attitudes. 

Anyways, we work at a chain restaurant in a college town where our policy is that if a guest walks out on their check without paying, it has to be at least $20 to even warrant a call to the police. (This is important) Even then, we usually just comp the meal off if it's not a significant amount on the rare occasion someone does walk out without paying. 

Long story short, Jim is bartending on Friday of Labor Day weekend when some 21 year old guy sits at the bar. He has two beers, orders an app, and goes outside on a couple occasions to smoke a cig. His bill is $20.50. On his last cig break Jim noticed that this kid is getting into his car and leaving, so he runs out and watches this dude try and navigate our parking lot for awhile before finding the exit and blowing through a red light as he speeds off. 

Jim decides to immediately call the police and report the guy. A little while later, a cop comes in to take Jim's statement, stating that they pulled the guy over for speeding down the road and after running his plates, realized he was the guy Jim had just reported. They said he was going to be arrested and would spend the weekend in jail, and since it was Labor Day weekend he wouldn't be released until Tuesday.

Now Jim can't stop bragging to anyone and everyone who will listen about how he sent this guy to jail over what was essentially a 50 cent ""loss"" to the company. 

I think he went over board and it was completely unnecessary to screw this over so badly
 I'm curious what other people think about it. 


Edit: Obviously I don't condone stealing from the restaurant or drinking and driving in any form. I realize my bias is more against Jim, simply because he's one of those guys you hate seeing having the satisfaction of knowing their right. 


TL;DR My coworker called the cops on a guy for walking out on a  $20.50 check. That guy had to spend 4 days in jail.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer, this happened over this past Labor Day weekend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one of my coworkers, let&amp;#39;s call him Jim, is one of those know it all servers who loves to correct people when they&amp;#39;re wrong and suck up to management. He actually used to be one of my managers at a previous restaurant but now he&amp;#39;s just a bartender/server, although he still often gets into his power trip attitudes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, we work at a chain restaurant in a college town where our policy is that if a guest walks out on their check without paying, it has to be at least $20 to even warrant a call to the police.

I still haven’t memorized all the specials, so I write them down every day, just to be safe.

Luckily, I noticed my mistake before I’d brought any checks to my tables, so I very embarrassedly asked my manager to void them.

Immediately after my checks were fixed, I turn around to notice a couple at the bar is ready to order, so I walk over and begin my intro when I feel a hand grab my arm and pull me away from this couple. I turn to see a coworker who is now loudly reprimanding me in front of the couple because apparently she had been waiting to take their order and I accidentally jumped her, essentially. So as if I wasn’t already embarrassed from ringing food in wrong, now I’m REALLY embarrassed.

I was already on the brink of tears and considering going somewhere to cry after picking up my last tables check, only to find their table and check abandoned.

So a lady and her 2 kids, between 4-6 and 7-9, came in today. She sat down next to the printer, I asked if she needed anything, and she was just here to print. Cool.

Then I overhear her micromanaging her kids.
Think ""DONT TOUCH THAT""
""STAY THERE AND SIT DOWN""
and the kids continue to do whatever.
I do my best to just ignore it.

She asks me a question about the printer and I help her out and get her back on track. Then proceed to clean some dishes in the back of my shop.

Then I see from the corner of my eye, she grabs her youngest by the forearm and slams him decently hard into on of the chairs.
He starts crying.

Idk what to do, because I'm so shocked.

After a bit, I decide the best option is to not confront her. I'm a petite girl(24) but tbh I look 19. Sticking my ass out there wont get those kids any less abused to be honest, and the conversation would go ""DONT TELL ME HOW TO PARENT MY KIDS, WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!?""

And it's not like I have enough information to contact CPS.
And if I piss her off, she'll probably go full shit-Mom mode on me, and probably take it out on her kids later :(

After maybe 5 min, the kids start spinning the seats of the stools we have at the front of the shop. This breaks them incredibly easily, and has in the past, so I politely ask them to stop.

""Sorry, could you guys not spin the stools? They break really easily.""

Then they proceed to begin standing ON TOP of the stools, which has to some kind of liability, but whatever. 

They leave, thank God.

""Staff is rude.""

Like Jesus Christ Karen, if you're gonna complain can you not abuse your kids and fucking buy something?

When youre feeling tired etc just know you are a fantastic mum and fantastic at your job! Sorry if this comes across really weird haha but I just thought I would let you know, you are brill ❤️❤️&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had the worst week and this made me feel so much better and I really wanted to share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was only able to reach out to me because of our small community, but you all need to know that even on your worst days, someone feels this way about you.&lt;/p&gt;

When I first started around a couple years ago as a host it was a god damn mess... every weekend shift, even as a host, was a mess of epic proportions and apparently loads of our regulars just stopped coming. I almost quit right away, but I was hired shortly after a new manager was hired who basically fired half the staff over the next year and rehired good people. I like my management so I worked hard to try to get my first serving position. They post what servers make per hour on the wall (which is creepy but whatever) and it was pretty motivating haha.

I was promoted to server a year ago and I've made way more money than I could ever make at minimum wage. I like my coworkers, and I like my managers and most of the BOH staff. All in all it was great, with a few hiccups that were smoothed over by making 2-3x as much as my previous job.

But the last few months have been hell... and it's getting worse. That new manager that was hired? I feel like she's having mental issues combined with being an alcoholic, and she's dropped the ball in a serious way... she's in charge of schedules and they have been seriously fucked up for months, even though we have the staff to staff correctly. I love her but I've noticed some problems for a while now... 

Three days out of the last week I've looked at the schedule over HotSchedules and *knew* it was gonna be a mess. Saturday we had no bartender so a server had to muddle along at it... the opening server had called out the day before with strep, and while he didn't call out the next day like he was supposed to, they did no planning whatsoever, seemingly  and just let the morning shift go to shit. There was no expo, no host, no togo, and for the night we were down two cooks on an already sparsely staffed BOH (manager said it'd be okay because she could jump on the line if needed.) And, to make it even better, our regional manager decided to visit... He's a nice guy but he was pissed, and it took all my restraint not to ask to talk to him (I don't like going to my bosses boss with my issues.)

That's just a small example... we are a corporate, metric driven restaurant and we've all been sat down recently to ask why collectively, all our numbers have went down. I went from a low 70% server approval to a low 60% just in the last month and I see it going down further because there's really no way to give great service with how badly things are going... I straight up told my manager that. I was given some bullshit about how on slower shifts it should make up for it... Yeah I get that but even on weekdays it's a mess now because management puts 6 servers on one night and 1 server on another (not an exaggeration... I asked a server to just show up on that day with only me in the bar and one in the dining room and she did and they allowed her to work.) I used to make up for the occasional shitshow, but now it feels like half my shifts are shitty.

My tips have weirdly enough gotten higher though because of all the pity tips, though I'm getting stiffed more often... it all balances out though and I average about $25-30 per hour. But multiple times a week it's a hot mess and we can't hold on to new staff anymore in a place that has servers that have been here for years and years (they are all talking about quitting.) 

My thing is, I make great money here and we are one of the busiest places in town... I suppose I could try to apply to a more upscale restaurant, or I could commute to work much further away... I'm just worried it's gonna be the same shit different place from all the horror stories of restaurants.

The management is, 3 out of 4 people, Awesome sauce. The fourth guy, though, is a grouchy, petty twat. Major bummer that he's the one who makes the schedules.  
When I got hired on, I was very up front that I wasn't doing it for the money- my finances are in the clear. I wanted the job to get out of the house a few days a week, make a little side cash for small luxury purchases (think; starbucks, a new game, beer for DnD night, etc), and because I genuinely enjoy being a waiter.   
Recently I've been taking over more and more of the week shifts, such as four or five doubles in a row, and being scheduled on days I have not been available since prior to hiring.   
Since I'm not strapped for money when it comes to bills, I haven't been overly concerned about what I make at the end of the night, but lately it's gone STEEPLY downhill. I might spend a solid eight to ten hours on my feet only to walk away with forty bucks- and the past few months that's been a GOOD night for me.  
I am running on fucking fumes at this point. After the second or third double in a row, I can't muster the energy to do jack shit around the house other than collapse in my bed and try to sleep in spite of aching limbs and feet so abused I limp when my alarm goes off and I crawl back to life.  
I spoke to the scheduling manager on the phone to remind him (...again...) that I'm not able to continue this trend, and while he's been more than wiling to reconfigure the schedule in the past for others, he more or less told me 'tough tiddies kiddies, see you at 10:30'.  
Welp, alright man. I've decided that I'm going to go in at 10:30 and speak to his boss about this problem, about how I have time consuming obligations outside of the restaurant that are being neglected for several weeks now, and I'm starting to suffer health-wise from the amount of time I'm spending here. That forty bucks a night no longer compensates me for the aches, pains, and general fatigue that are resulting from these unwanted hours.   
So he can either fix the schedule to what I agreed to at being hired (4-6 shifts a week, not 9-12), or as a professional courtesy he can pick what 4-6 shifts he needs me to do this week and fire me for No-Call-No-Show on the rest of 'em.

&lt;p&gt;How do certain states get away with paying servers so poorly?  Not only did I basicly get an $8 raise, I&amp;#39;m required by, New York state to take a 30 minute break every six hours.  What are breaks?!  If I am not able to take that break, I get paid an extra $1.50 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is just crazy to me!  It&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m working another job on top of my existing job because of the rate per hour they pay servers here!  I know cost of living is more expensive up here, and taxes are crazy af, but I&amp;#39;m not living in NYC, so it&amp;#39;s not all that bad.  I can&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;ve been serving tables for all these years for such a low pay rate.  So kudos to, NY state!&lt;/p&gt;

So my birthday was this past Friday, and the day before that, I had planned a lunch with about 9 friends plus my boyfriend. 

Unfortunately, 8/9 of my friends either had not responded or had last minute excuses. Some genuinely had work, but most of them were unresponsive. 

This really bummed me out and I ended up crying during lunch. I had already bought a cake and I was really looking forward to seeing my friends, as I serve/host 3/7 days and have school 5/7 days. 

I ended up taking the cake to my moms restaurant where my baby brother had a go at getting messy with it. It was nice seeing him and having him enjoy it, as I only get to see my brothers once a week as I live in the neighboring city. 

Anyway, so this past Saturday I was working as a server. 

I had a big top but unfortunately, I was very busy and neglected getting to them for a bit longer than I wanted. 

When I finally got there, I did my usual spiel and introduced myself and took drink orders. They were a family of 6, two parents and 3 daughters with one boyfriend it looked like. 

Right off the bat they were super polite. They looked me in the eye to speak to me and asked me how I was doing. 

I got back with the drink orders and right as the dad was making conversation with me (addressing me politely by my name, I may add) I spilled two waters all over myself and a bit on the mom! 

I was mortified, but they made lighthearted jokes and I hurriedly cleaned the mess. 

Throughout the rest of the meal, everyone called me by name and we kept joking back and forth with each other. They really made me feel like part of the family for an hour and it was such a wholesome experience all around. Everyone was so lovely and they remarked that I had the same name as their cousin! 

I also drew them a picture of Spider-Man haha. I usually draw on spare receipts for little kids but I thought these people were so amazing I just had to return any favor I knew how. 

After they left, I realized they tipped me on top of the automatic gratuity! (We have an automatic grat for big tables). They left me a note that said “an extra thank you”.

Going home that night I honestly cried a bit. They made me feel so welcome and they made my crappy birthday celebration into a dream. 

I carried that positivity onto the rest of my shift and I didn’t even care I had a couple of late tables. I was so elated beyond belief. 

The experience was so positive that I didn’t care about the money. At all. They could’ve stiffed me and I would’ve been grateful for how welcoming and polite they were. 

I printed out a copy of their receipt to which I now use as a notebook for my textbook. 

I hope to see them again. And maybe hand out an adoption form haha.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I begin, I’ll give some back story. &lt;/p&gt;

Q: My wife and I and our 4-year-old son were out to dinner last week. It was a medium-nice restaurant, not fast food, but not super fancy either. My son is a normal, active little boy, and it’s hard for him to sit through a whole dinner, so we let him explore the restaurant a little. I noticed our waitress giving him the hairy eyeball, so we asked him to stop running. He was pretty good about it after that, but he did get underfoot when she was carrying a tray, and she spoke to him pretty sharply to go back to our table and sit down. I felt it was completely uncalled for, and she should have come and spoken to us personally instead of disciplining someone else’s child.

I tipped 5 percent and spoke briefly to her manager, who gave noncommittal replies. My wife agrees with me, but when we posted about it on Facebook, we got a lot of judgy responses.

A: Yeah, this is your fault. It’s hugely your fault. Of course it’s hard for a 4-year-old to sit still, which is why people usually stick to fast-dining establishments while working on restaurant manners. It’s why one parent usually responds to a fidgety kid who wants to “explore” by taking him outside the restaurant, where he can get his wiggles out while not taking laps around servers precariously carrying trays of (often extremely hot) food and drink.

A kid “exploring” a restaurant is not a thing. When you did intervene, it wasn’t to get him back in his seat. It was just to instruct him to “stop running.” You weren’t parenting, so a server did it for you. She was right. You were wrong.

Your son is not ready to eat at a “medium-nice” restaurant again until he is capable of behaving a little better. You can practice at home. You can practice at McDonald’s. You can try a real restaurant again with the understanding that one of you may need to take him out when he starts getting the urge to run an obstacle course.

I doubt that you will do this, but I encourage you to return the restaurant, apologize to the manager for complaining about your server, and leave her a proper tip.

Mend your wicked ways.

My first post ever on reddit! I’ve had a couple of stories I wanted to share here and there but this one reaaally took the cake for me last night. 

So I serve at a restaurant known for their “southern hospitality” and the rocking chairs in the front. We have a retail store attached. Now, we know the deal with closing as servers - checking tables, checking sidework in the back, etc. Cashier is one of the few job codes I don’t have, so I don’t know what their closing duties are but I know they have to wait for the last guest to leave and then they can pretty much go after the manager has taken what’s it in the registers. 

So! I switched with someone so I could close last night, because even though I made my goal, I still wanted some extra so I can fix my savings situation. It had slowed down to the point where the BOH closer started his duties about an hour before close and I took tables as they came in in the front. 

A table of three walks in at 20 til close and go up to greet them at the host stand and I recognize one of the women as someone who works in retail. Someone who has closed as a cashier before. Someone who complains when people stay come in late and stay late. This is gonna be relevant, y’all. 

She apologized for coming so late saying her family wanted to eat here and while it was a little late I was in a good mood, having gone over my goal and things were going well closing-duties wise, so I was just like, “Haha, nah, you’re fine! For how many tonight, three?” 

It was her turn to laugh, “no, actually, it’s gonna be ten of us.” 

Bitch, what? Bitch whaaaaaaaat? Did I mention she’s closed before? Did I mention she’s complained about having to stay late for people? Did I mention it was only three people there out of the ten at 20 minutes until close?? 

We had tables open but I was still recovering from the audacity, the fucking audacity that I told them to give me a second to get some tables together (my voice might’ve gotten a little high pitched at this point) and I went to go tell my coworker. I had barely gotten halfway through when he stopped me like, “Oh, is it Tiffany*? Yeah, that’s the third time she’s done that in the past week.” The. Third. Time.

Then she comes around and says, “oh, sorry pendeja (me), but my mom wants (BOH closer) to serve us.” 

That’s fine by me! I can’t look at your face right now! Sounds good! 

They had it down to a science, y’all. The three of them ordered for everyone who hadn’t shown up yet, and our closing manager was mad on our behalf and he was saying if the others showed up after we closed we were not letting them in and the three who were there would have to pay for what was made. But at about five til close, the rest of the party showed up, in their church T-shirt’s. They tipped the BOH closer well, but stayed for a full hour after close. So I was essentially working for free the whole time they were there and then for the clean up after they left. 

I’m just. I don’t understand how someone can work in a restaurant, much less have CLOSED before, and still have the fucking audacity. Tiffany* is dead to me. I hope the next time she’s closing as cashier a party of 15 comes in right before close. All split checks, too.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi y’all!

Alright, lets preface this with all of the current servers were all hired before the manager took over. Our old manager, and the two or three managers under her at quit at the same time due to an article coming out about a lot of our franchises closing. 

The old manager wasn't terrible, but she didn't do much, let a lot of things slide, but kept a really good flow through the restaurant. It was mainly the managers under her that kept things steady, but we didn't have any walkouts, even on our busiest nights, the servers were all a lot happier, and working was a lot more chipper.

After that, we had some corporate managers come in to fix the place up, make more policies for our store, and get us all on the same page as far as regulations, food handling, what our numbers should look like each night, telling us how and when to serve, etc. because we've been doing it ""all wrong"", whatever, wrote that off because they'll be gone soon.

 The only issue I had is when I was taking food off the heat window to put on my tray and one of the corporate women put the food back in the window while I was reaching to put some butter on the cakes in front of me. I asked her what she was doing and she told me the food has to be served immediately out of the window. Folks, me putting butter on those cakes take 3 seconds at most. She did that to me *three more times*. Whatever, they'll be gone soon I kept telling myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving onto recently, our new manager is...awful. After a couple days of her working I pinned her as a nitpick type manager, as she grabbed my ponytail and complained about it touching my shoulders. Then a few days after that she was talking about other servers to me and I concluded she likes to get information on people to ""figure them out"" and use it against them later.

For some reason, she gossips to me a lot about the other servers, at first I didn't realize why she tells me the things she does but later assumed this was something she does to other servers as well as some sort of tactic. 

I was smart enough to keep my mouth shut about other servers because they are my friends, and they would do the same. 

Turns out, we had a server yell at the new manager because she refused to let her go on a smoke break before 2pm. The manager wrote her up and made a ""matter of fact"" statement that not one of us servers will walk all over her and she doesn't take shit, and if anyone of us causes her a problem again she will write us up too. The server quit that night. 

Then the next day we lost *3 other servers, a host, and a baker* for our store. That was about 1/3 of our staff, maybe more. This was the day before Sunday, which most of you know caused absolute hell. We had over *15 tables* walk out because they weren't getting their food fast enough, I was talked down to for being on the opposite side of the restaurant from my section because I was taking food out. Which we had drilled in our heads that taking food is the number one priority, you drop everything to serve food regardless if it's for another servers table or not. 

The new manager let us down and has not learned any lessons. We are losing more servers, and I was offered a better position in the restaurant because of it. It's not a raise or anything, just a better title. I don't want to lose tips because of walkouts and I don't want to shut down because of the manager being a bitch.

So, to preface, I work in a family owned restauraunt that has 3 locations. I call them West, North, and South. I work at West, owner still works at North as a manager.

So, there I am, just myself during a semi busy lunch. Nothing I couldn't handle, but really didn't have time to do anything but serve. A couple comes in and sits at a booth and I go over to greet them. I didn't realize they were deaf and when I asked the man what he'd like to drink I really couldn't understand him and he kept pointing to the lady, so I asked her what she'd like to drink. After much motioning and her telling me they're deaf I realized they wanted a water and tea. Cool, easy. Should have just pointed to a menu item, but whatevs. Put the order in and I'm on my way

I take some food out, a few more orders, and I realize my drinks aren't up. I wait for the bartender to come back from wherever he was since at this restaurant we can't get our own drinks, and the man of the couple starts making the drinking motion and the lady is doing the 🤷 but pissed off. I give them a thumbs up and point to the bar well where I'm standing. The bartender comes and I ask him where my drinks were and he must have lost the ticket. He gets my tea and water and as I'm going to the table, I see them storming out and the man angrily doing the ""forget it"" motion. Okaaaaaay. 

I have other tables to wait on, so I bus their table, see the lady left some lotion there but just throw it away. She comes back and asks for it and I tell her that I threw it away but it's on top and I can still get it for her. She says yes, so I give it to her and she gives me this this disgusted looks, screeches ""it was in the trash?!?"" and huffs at me. At this point I'm over it, I have actual paying customers who arnt going to give me attitude, and just go ""yeaaaah..."" and to my next table. 

They ended up going to the North location, telling the owner I refused to serve them or take their order, I was a ""rude bitch""  the entire time, etc BECAUSE THEY WERE DEAF. Then write an email about it. THEN tell another co-worker of mine who lives close to them about it. All with me getting more horrible and discriminative with each retelling. My manager's tired of hearing about it, I'm tired of hearing about it, and now they say they're never coming back blah blah blah. 

Good.

I just think it's **reeeaaal** interesting that they didn't have the time to wait or even ask me what was taking so long for their drinks before pulling the deaf card and walking out, but **did** have the time to complain to 3 people, the owner, and in writing.

&lt;p&gt;The time comes to pay her bill which comes out to be $33.65 since she had some drinks with her lunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple minutes later I come back to pick up the bill (she was still there) and she had only put down $30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I politely explained that she still owed 3.65 for her lunch. She kinda rolled her eyes at me and said she’d get it in a second. I go to check on another table and when I come back, she’s gone. She put down an additional $3 but still owed 0.65. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did this lady not tip, she still owed money on her bill.  I know 65 cents doesn’t sound like a super big deal but the fact is I now have to pay to cover the rest of your lunch. I basically paid her to be a total bitch to me. It’s just so annoying when someone can’t just be a decent human being and AT LEAST pay the total amount owed on the bill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total jerk move.&lt;/p&gt;

Me is me. Weirdo is sandwich guy.

Weirdo and his wife come in for a late lunch, a couple in their late 30s'. They seem nice enough, and I quickly take their order. She gets a salad, he gets a club with fries. It doesn't take long to make, and we weren't busy at the time.

A few minutes later, the salad comes up first, and I bring to the wife. Then, the club. As the kitchen guy was handing me the basket with the club, it slips from my hands and falls all over the counter. I get all embarrassed, and the owner laughs a bit, says its no big deal, and the kitchen guy shrugs and goes to make a new one.

I go over to the table.

Me: Your sandwich accidentally fell, so the kitchen is making you a new one and a fresh batch of fries. It'll just be a few minutes.

Weirdo: Alright, no problem.

We had started to pre-cook some of our bacon, and a club doesn't take long to make so maybe five minutes later I had a brand new club and fries made for him. I bring it over to him, and ask if he needs anything else. He says no. The wife says she loves her salad.

A few minutes later, I head back and see his sandwich is untouched.

Me: Is everything ok?

Weirdo: No. I just...I can't eat this club.

Me: Is something wrong with it? Would you like me to take it back?

Weirdo: Please. I just can't eat it. Just, when you told me it fell...and given how quickly you had the new one made, I can't psychologically get the idea out of my head that you just picked it up off the ground and put it back together.

Me: No, we made it fresh. I threw the other one out.

I go get the owner, and she explains that we were in the middle of pre-cooking our bacon, and that clubs generally don't take long to make anyway.

After she leaves, the guy looks at me again.

Weirdo: Yea...I dunno. I just can't psychologically eat this. I don't want to pay for it. Can you take it off my bill?

Me: ... Uh, yea. Yea, sure. Can I get you anything else to eat...?

Weirdo: No, I'll pick at the fries.

The wife offered me the advice that in the future, to NOT tell people that their food fell and that you are making them a new order of whatever they had ordered. I had no reply.  First, that's a usual server default, and second, it's true in this case. I'd rather my tables know WHY their food might a few extra minutes than have them wait while everyone else east. I like to be honest with my tables, whether the kitchen made a mistake or their food fell.

And I guess I learned that you CAN'T psychologically eat a sandwich.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happened today at a small little restaurant I work at. Me is me. Weirdo is sandwich guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go get the owner, and she explains that we were in the middle of pre-cooking our bacon, and that clubs generally don&amp;#39;t take long to make anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After she leaves, the guy looks at me again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weirdo: Yea...I dunno. I just can&amp;#39;t psychologically eat this. I don&amp;#39;t want to pay for it. Can you take it off my bill?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: ... Uh, yea. Yea, sure. Can I get you anything else to eat...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weirdo: No, I&amp;#39;ll pick at the fries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wife offered me the advice that in the future, to NOT tell people that their food fell and that you are making them a new order of whatever they had ordered. I had no reply.  First, that&amp;#39;s a usual server default, and second, it&amp;#39;s true in this case. I&amp;#39;d rather my tables know WHY their food might a few extra minutes than have them wait while everyone else east. I like to be honest with my tables, whether the kitchen made a mistake or their food fell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I guess I learned that you CAN&amp;#39;T psychologically eat a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s Sunday, at our favorite CF restaurant. 

I’m working my section and trying not to hate Sunday people with the fire of 1000 suns.(this fails)

I have a gentleman in his 60s sat at a 4 top, but I don’t  care because it’s Sunday, I get screwed over consistently over and over again. It’s our busiest day, I just take what comes at me at this point. 

So I get the fellow his breakfast and he looks a little haggard. I wonder to myself if he is light on sleep, and twice when I walk out into the dining room he is counting money. Like...a fat stack of mixed bills. Hundreds, fifties, tens, fives and ones. 
Enough that I was thought to myself DUDE this is not the place to be doing that, anywhere in public.  He had a couple grand easy. 

I think nothing of it, as there is a casino across town and it’s not completely unusual for people to come to us after winning a good amount over there. 

He leaves while I’m running food for one of the other servers and I notice there is no money on the table. I’m super annoyed because this dude obviously didn’t tip on a card, he had SO MUCH CASH. 

Which whatever. He was tired, maybe he was poor. I don’t know I don’t think much about it after this long in the industry. (ALTHOUGH FUCK YOU DUDE THAT LEFT ME $6 ON A $60 TAB BECAUSE YOUR FOOD TOOK TOO LONG, I HOPE YOU CHOKE ON A GIANT BAG OF USED ANAL DILDOS). 

I get double sat (by my manager 🙄) and go out to great my new tables and grab dishes. I look down and see a colorful paper. 

IT WAS A FREAKING HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL.

Now here is where is gets a little weird. 
It wasn’t just laying on the floor. I actually had to pull it out from underneath the table leg. 

So either karma did that dude the most real justice that ever exists, or he decided to play hide and seek with my tip. I’ve mulled it over in my head all evening. 

I’m going to wait a couple days to deposit it just in case, just in CASE it somehow was dropped, but I actually had to PULL it out from under the leg so I just think more and more that is was a crazy ass tip or something.

I have had the weirdest week. So much good karma but I have struggled REALLY hard mental health wise the last two weeks so I wonder if this is the universe saying, Lucy, it’s ok. You aren’t unlucky anymore. 😂

My mental health is improving and once I decide this found 100 Is mine...I think it will be even better.

Here’s how the interaction goes:

Me: “hey guys how are we doing today?”

No response 

Me: “okay can i get you Guys something to drink?”

No response 

Me: “okay so we need a couple minutes to think about drinks?”

Them: “ no we know what we want”

I proceed to take their drink orders and hand their drinks down. No thank you’s or anything, whatever. I asked them if i can grab their soup and salad while they look at their menus, they say yes and give me what they want as well as an app. I get their app shit in and bring it out to them. I didn’t get a single thank you but whatever it happens. Now, when i have tables of 5 or more i grate an entire block of cheese on a side plate that way people can control how much cheese they want and it’s just easier for me rather than to reach over everyone to grate cheese for each individual person. 

Them: “ we need new silverware ours is dirty.”

I nod my head and go to get new rolls of silverware and when i come back they say they want to leave. I didn’t even take their order yet. 

Me: “and why do u want to leave?”

Them: “first of all you grated cheese on the side when they always put it on our meals instead. Also when he asked for silverware you didn’t respond. No words came out of your mouth.”

Me: “ i apologize for nodding your silverware is right there”

Them: “no we just want to leave.”

So i grab the manager who goes out to talk to them. Afterwards she pulls me into the office and explains to me that the head lady insisted i was racist for assuming i thought they wanted a lot of cheese since they were black (is that even a stereotype?)

She comped their app and gave them a $40 gift card. I’ve never heard the race card being pulled over such a dumb thing. I’m white for reference if you were wondering. They had a cold aura when i first greeted them and seemed irritated that i even existed from the moment i opened my mouth, hence why i just nodded my head. Anything to not irate them anymore.

So I'm a host, but we also buss the tables. I'm training a new girl during an opening shift and all is going well. An older woman walks in and says she’s waiting for her friend, but she likes *that* specific booth behind that divider and points. I look down at our seating chart and I tell her that unfortunately someone is already seated there. She shakes her head and makes me go walk over and confirm that’s my seating chart is correct, but whatever it could be wrong. I once again tell her that there are people there after I go check. She then asks me how long they’ve been seated and at tell her 30 minutes (we use an ipad for our hosting so we have exact times for when the table is marked). The new hosts laughs and says maybe they’ll be gone by the time your friend gets here. The older woman nods and takes a seat. 

About fifteen minutes later the friend arrives and the new girl goes to seat them at a different booth since the booth they wanted was still occupied. As she’s walking by, the people from the booth she wanted get up and leave. 

The new host says “i guess it’s your lucky day! We can buss this for you ladies” and puts the menus down at a table next to the booth. I sit in the booth to start bussing it when the first older lady sits across from me. As I was stacking plates she points to a plate with one breadstick left on it. 

Lady: oh what a shame that’s they left that’s perfectly good breadstick. 

Me: Oh yeah, I always feel so bad throwing out all this food. 

L: Well I’ll eat it!

I kinda just look at her because I can’t tell if she was joking or not. She then picks up the breadstick and takes a bite. I just smile at her and grab the dishes and walk away while the other host wipes the table. 

I know this isn’t super interesting but it was just so weird to me. I don’t mind sharing food with people, but eating a strangers leftovers is just a bit much for me.

She shakes her head and makes me go walk over and confirm that’s my seating chart is correct, but whatever it could be wrong. I once again tell her that there are people there after I go check. She then asks me how long they’ve been seated and at tell her 30 minutes (we use an ipad for our hosting so we have exact times for when the table is marked). The new hosts laughs and says maybe they’ll be gone by the time your friend gets here. The older woman nods and takes a seat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About fifteen minutes later the friend arrives and the new girl goes to seat them at a different booth since the booth they wanted was still occupied. As she’s walking by, the people from the booth she wanted get up and leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new host says “i guess it’s your lucky day! We can buss this for you ladies” and puts the menus down at a table next to the booth. I sit in the booth to start bussing it when the first older lady sits across from me. As I was stacking plates she points to a plate with one breadstick left on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: oh what a shame that’s they left that’s perfectly good breadstick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Oh yeah, I always feel so bad throwing out all this food. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L: Well I’ll eat it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kinda just look at her because I can’t tell if she was joking or not. She then picks up the breadstick and takes a bite. I just smile at her and grab the dishes and walk away while the other host wipes the table. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this isn’t super interesting but it was just so weird to me. I don’t mind sharing food with people, but eating a strangers leftovers is just a bit much for me. An odd first day for the new host of course.&lt;/p&gt;

Background: So over the last year I worked at a local village pub in the village I grew up in in England, between my MA and the start of my PhD. It's a tiny little village with two pubs, a church, a cornershop and a chippy - that's it other than houses. On the whole it's been a pretty great experience - it's only a small place and the village is in the middle of nowhere so it's not particularly busy and you get to know lots of the locals and regulars who were mostly nice people. Although I was hired as a mostly part-time bar staff, I ended up doing lots more, particularly waiting on the tables as we have a small restaurant and we serve pub food in the bar as well. I'm more comfortable behind the bar but we only have a very small number of staff so we all end up doing pretty much everything anyway (serving drinks, waiting tables, changing beer barrels, sometimes even helping out the potwash on busy days) We have a few room upstairs which function as a kind of B&amp;B and we often get businesspeople staying there between their visits to some of the bigger nearby cities. This happened maybe 2 months ago, and was the first and last time I ever received a formal complaint.

So there's a couple who are staying for 2 nights in one of the room upstairs. First time I'd seen them since I checked them in and gave them the keys earlier. We're basically rammed in the bar, there's me, the manager, and a waitress with about 13 tables and 3-4 covers per table. So I go over to their table to take their order. ""Hi, how's your day going? Happy with the room upstairs? What would you like to order?"" etc. It's a Friday which is a curry night for us, so the wife ordered a Chicken Balti curry and the husband ordered one of our 'Chef's Specials' dishes which was basically a salmon/rice dish which looked lovely. Anyway, it's totally rammed, the kitchen are backed up because there's only two chefs here, so about 35 minutes later their dishes are ready and I bring them out (in the meantime I've been apologising for the wait and getting them refills etc.)

Here's the crux of it: As I put the dishes down, the wife says ""I'm very sorry, I should have said earlier, but I actually have a deathly peanut allergy, so can I check if this dish has any nuts in it?"" Internally I'm thinking: Well you should have fucking said that when I took the order, or at literally any point in the last 35 minutes shouldn't you?? What I actually said was ""Okay, I'm going to go straight to the kitchen to double check, please don't touch it until I come back just in case there are nuts in it."" We do have an allergy chart but because the curries are basically mix and match on a Friday (curry vs filling, plus sides etc) it's not always obvious, and they change pretty frequently. So I basically run to the kitchen and the chef runs down the list of ingredients and says that the curry paste has peanuts in it so she probably shouldn't have it. Shit. Okay, so I run back to their table and explain ""I'm very sorry but the curry will have nuts in it so it won't be safe for you to eat it. I can run it by my manager but I'm sure he'd be fine to offer you another dish which is suitable for you"" (The manager is super chill and I'm 100% certain he'd be fine to just get them another plate of food and have them leave happy. In the end he gave them a drink each on the house to apologise) Thankfully the husband just switches their plates, so he has the curry and she has the salmon special (which is nut-free). I checked in on them 10 minutes later and they were both enjoying their food. I also cleared their table at the end and brought them the bill where they again said how happy they were with the food. I apologised again for the confusion (even though it's 100% on them; if you have a serious peanut allergy you'd think you'd let the waiter know so the kitchen know too!) and they left a decent tip. Anyway, I clocked out about an hour later, had a pint at the bar and went home thinking all was fine. I definitely do take *partial* responsibility because in hindsight, I probably should have specifically asked them if they had any allergies as I took their order, but a) I was rushed off my feet and b) you'd think if you knew you had that allergy you wouldn't just let the waiter walk away, and then wait 35 minutes, without saying anything.

A couple of days later I was in the pub as a customer, just having a pint outside and reading my book when one of the two owners comes over and says ""Hi \[me\], can I just have a quick chat with you about something that happened the other day?"" ""Sure, what's up?"" And she explains that the husband went to his room after the meal but the wife ended up staying in the bar for hours and getting very drunk on wine, and then spent ages outside on the terrace drunkenly complaining to anyone who would listen that ""The waiter deliberately served me a dish I'm allergic to!"" So she was there until close and later (probably til about midnight) drinking and slandering myself and the pub in general to every single customer there, potentially damaging our reputation and business. Not only that, she submitted a formal complaint about it to the hotel booking company she went through! Thankfully I explained the situation to the boss as I did here (that I took their order, brought it out 35 minutes later and only then did she make us aware she had an allergy; they swapped dishes, both of them enjoyed their food, and seemed to leave happy) and she was totally cool about it, she's had difficult customers before. I'm one of the most reliable staff they've had in a while and I do a good job so they tend to have my back in these sorts of situations. One of the most annoying customers I've had there. Why would I *deliberately* try to kill you with your food??

tl;dr if you have an allergy, particularly a severe one, *make sure your waiter is aware before they take your order or bring you your food*","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First time posting here!&lt;/p&gt;

On the whole it&amp;#39;s been a pretty great experience - it&amp;#39;s only a small place and the village is in the middle of nowhere so it&amp;#39;s not particularly busy and you get to know lots of the locals and regulars who were mostly nice people. Although I was hired as a mostly part-time bar staff, I ended up doing lots more, particularly waiting on the tables as we have a small restaurant and we serve pub food in the bar as well. I&amp;#39;m more comfortable behind the bar but we only have a very small number of staff so we all end up doing pretty much everything anyway (serving drinks, waiting tables, changing beer barrels, sometimes even helping out the potwash on busy days) We have a few room upstairs which function as a kind of B&amp;amp;B and we often get businesspeople staying there between their visits to some of the bigger nearby cities. This happened maybe 2 months ago, and was the first and last time I ever received a formal complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s a couple who are staying for 2 nights in one of the room upstairs. First time I&amp;#39;d seen them since I checked them in and gave them the keys earlier. We&amp;#39;re basically rammed in the bar, there&amp;#39;s me, the manager, and a waitress with about 13 tables and 3-4 covers per table. So I go over to their table to take their order. &amp;quot;Hi, how&amp;#39;s your day going? Happy with the room upstairs? What would you like to order?&amp;quot; etc. It&amp;#39;s a Friday which is a curry night for us, so the wife ordered a Chicken Balti curry and the husband ordered one of our &amp;#39;Chef&amp;#39;s Specials&amp;#39; dishes which was basically a salmon/rice dish which looked lovely. Anyway, it&amp;#39;s totally rammed, the kitchen are backed up because there&amp;#39;s only two chefs here, so about 35 minutes later their dishes are ready and I bring them out (in the meantime I&amp;#39;ve been apologising for the wait and getting them refills etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the crux of it: As I put the dishes down, the wife says &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m very sorry, I should have said earlier, but I actually have a deathly peanut allergy, so can I check if this dish has any nuts in it?&amp;quot; Internally I&amp;#39;m thinking: Well you should have fucking said that when I took the order, or at literally any point in the last 35 minutes shouldn&amp;#39;t you?? What I actually said was &amp;quot;Okay, I&amp;#39;m going to go straight to the kitchen to double check, please don&amp;#39;t touch it until I come back just in case there are nuts in it.&amp;quot; We do have an allergy chart but because the curries are basically mix and match on a Friday (curry vs filling, plus sides etc) it&amp;#39;s not always obvious, and they change pretty frequently. So I basically run to the kitchen and the chef runs down the list of ingredients and says that the curry paste has peanuts in it so she probably shouldn&amp;#39;t have it. Shit. Okay, so I run back to their table and explain &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m very sorry but the curry will have nuts in it so it won&amp;#39;t be safe for you to eat it. I can run it by my manager but I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;d be fine to offer you another dish which is suitable for you&amp;quot; (The manager is super chill and I&amp;#39;m 100% certain he&amp;#39;d be fine to just get them another plate of food and have them leave happy. In the end he gave them a drink each on the house to apologise) Thankfully the husband just switches their plates, so he has the curry and she has the salmon special (which is nut-free). I checked in on them 10 minutes later and they were both enjoying their food. I also cleared their table at the end and brought them the bill where they again said how happy they were with the food. I apologised again for the confusion (even though it&amp;#39;s 100% on them; if you have a serious peanut allergy you&amp;#39;d think you&amp;#39;d let the waiter know so the kitchen know too!) and they left a decent tip. Anyway, I clocked out about an hour later, had a pint at the bar and went home thinking all was fine. I definitely do take &lt;em&gt;partial&lt;/em&gt; responsibility because in hindsight, I probably should have specifically asked them if they had any allergies as I took their order, but a) I was rushed off my feet and b) you&amp;#39;d think if you knew you had that allergy you wouldn&amp;#39;t just let the waiter walk away, and then wait 35 minutes, without saying anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later I was in the pub as a customer, just having a pint outside and reading my book when one of the two owners comes over and says &amp;quot;Hi [me], can I just have a quick chat with you about something that happened the other day?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Sure, what&amp;#39;s up?&amp;quot; And she explains that the husband went to his room after the meal but the wife ended up staying in the bar for hours and getting very drunk on wine, and then spent ages outside on the terrace drunkenly complaining to anyone who would listen that &amp;quot;The waiter deliberately served me a dish I&amp;#39;m allergic to!&amp;quot; So she was there until close and later (probably til about midnight) drinking and slandering myself and the pub in general to every single customer there, potentially damaging our reputation and business. Not only that, she submitted a formal complaint about it to the hotel booking company she went through! Thankfully I explained the situation to the boss as I did here (that I took their order, brought it out 35 minutes later and only then did she make us aware she had an allergy; they swapped dishes, both of them enjoyed their food, and seemed to leave happy) and she was totally cool about it, she&amp;#39;s had difficult customers before. I&amp;#39;m one of the most reliable staff they&amp;#39;ve had in a while and I do a good job so they tend to have my back in these sorts of situations. One of the most annoying customers I&amp;#39;ve had there. Why would I &lt;em&gt;deliberately&lt;/em&gt; try to kill you with your food??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr if you have an allergy, particularly a severe one, &lt;em&gt;make sure your waiter is aware before they take your order or bring you your food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

First time poster here. Been checking out this subreddit ever since I started my newest serving job a couple of months ago. I work in fine dining/ casual . Small corporation Seafood and steak house. Not super expensive but not cheap either. Anyways, bills rack up QUICK with out appetizers and main entrees. As servers we honestly do make a lot of money within the short shifts that we usually work - only about 5 hour shifts. Anyways when I started I came from casual dining so I did need quite some training to get used to our water service and bread service. 


I have been doing great and this job is a godsend because I’ve been doing serving for almost 2 years now since I went back to school and only have time to work 3-4 days a week. I work the weekends and mostly the busier sections because I can handle it. However last night , I had an odd couple and their friend come in - Friday around 8-9pm. They were extremely standoffish from the start but I give everyone the same attitude and service - which is happy and helpful. They ordered appetizers and then main entree food (with lots of modifications for the food). As soon as their appetizer comes in I check in and the girl who was in the group is gone . The guy explains to me that she has an emergency and that they all just need to leave ASAP and to cancel the food. I had to rush to the kitchen to cancel everything but it was about 15 mins in and almost everything was done, I let my manager know the heads up and proceed to come to the table with just the appetizer bill but the customers had left. My manager sees that and proceeds to yell at me in front of my other tables as if it was my fault. One of my tables actually felt bad because they saw him yell at me and left me a large cash tip on top of the credit card tip. 

Anyways that was last night (Friday) And today Saturday I came to work early only to be called to an empty section to get talked to by all the managers. They proceeded to have me explain what happened with that dine and dash situation only to turn it around on me and say how “you should have been faster to leave the bill” “you should have served the table better they were in a rush”,   

Quick side note - our restaurant is popular and wait times are about 30 mins 

They said how it was completely my fault. I proceeded to defend myself with facts and stating that I have been on time to work every shift. Have tons of amazing yelp reviews, have never had a customer or table complain about my service , have high sales - to which they started to say things about my overall performance . “ you’re uniform is horrible, your shirt isn’t always  ironed correctly, sometimes you don’t wear a black belt, you have the top
Button always unbuttoned”. That was literally the only thing they could complain about me and said how all these rules are in the “employee handbook”. I feel like they wouldn’t ever fire me but they take these things serious so by them brutalizing me with small details like this they are in turn trying to condition me to be absolutely perfect . And it’s disgusting I feel like and abusive behavior. We actually have a yelp review about a lady complaining that she over heard the manager talk badly about the servers.

I've worked fast food for 2 years, and I started when I was 16. Obviously, I've spent the majority of my career as a minor but I dont take bullshit from customers. I go to work to pay rent, not to be stepped on.  Anyways a few months ago, it was busy. I work in the busiest restaurant our district has, we serve 200 cars an hour when we have good staff. Today however, we didnt. 2 of our 6 staff for the day called out and no one could cover. Im working a double, around my 11th hour and tired out of my mind. I was in drive thru and expediting alone but our times were 15-20 minutes from cook times.
 Up comes the two shittiest women I have ever encountered in my time working. They had a big order, and as they paid the driver was rude as hell. As I'm waiting for their food the passenger gets out of their car and walks through the drive thru to our lobby to complain (yell) that we were taking too long and that she was going to call corp. When that didnt get a rise out of us (we had already been threatened multiple times that day, she didnt phase us) she goes back to her car and pulls out her phone to record us. 
Now you see, I knew whats up. I was told its very illegal to record minors without their permission. I knew I had this shit when I saw it, and I was so excited for a little justice. 
W1 and W2 are the customers. W1 has the phone.

Me: Ma'am I need you to put your phone away and to stop recording me.

W1: I can do what I want, its my phone!

Me: I'm 17. Its illegal to record minors without their permission and I am telling you that I do not consent.

W2: We need proof that you cant do your job correctly.

At this point I was already damn near tears. Listen, being told youre scum all day by tons of adults really drains your fucking energy. My voice is super shakey while I'm talking to her but im still confident.

Me: I am running an entire drive thru by myself. Ive offered you coupons and half off your order. If it doesnt satisfy you I'm happy to refund your order so I can work on getting the people behind you out of here. 

Their food is pretty much ready so I close the window and leave to bag it up, i take another giant order (60$) and try to compose myself knowing its only getting worse. But I wasnt about to let them get away with that video.

When I come back they seem to have a response ready but I interrupt them.

Me: I need you to delete any video or pictures you took of me or my coworkers. 

W1: No, its my evidence of your terrible service. I will never come to (name of place) ever again!

Me: I will call the police if you do not delete them. 

This makes them hella angry

W2: We are CUSTOMERS. WE PAY YOU. You need to get rid of your attitude!!!! 

W1: Call the police?? I should call the police on YOU for wasting our time!!!

I laughed, I really did. I shouldnt have, but I did. I closed the window and got on my phone, typed in 911 and showed it to them through the window. W2 flipped me off and they sped out of our drive thru, 50 dollars of food left behind. 

Although I never saw them delete the video I found out that it actually isnt illegal so their money was wasted for an empty threat lmao. They were never compensated and I never recieved repercussions. If they did share that video I havent seen it.

The last restaurant I worked at was a more ""high end"" Italian bistro. At least that's what it liked to call itself. I will admit it had good homemade food though it was quite overpriced for the area. 

The owner was a monster and we had a high turnover rate for staff (waitstaff in particular) because of her. At one point I was the youngest person on staff but I was also the most senior waitstaff and trained all new-hires that came in at the time. Despite that most of my coworkers seemed to regard me as under them based on my age. It didn't really bother me all that much as long as I could get the work done and go home.  Though one coworker I had trained had picked up a habit of passing off difficult tasks to other people any time she could, most often to me because I was younger. Her worst habit was passing off tables she knew were difficult or thought wouldn't be worth her time to other servers (mostly at the end of the night).  So there was this couple that started to frequent the restaurant.  I hadn't waited on them before but apparently they had within their first visit gained a reputation of being ""Needy"" and a ""pain to deal with"" so as soon as they walked through the door that night my coworker scoffed and told the hostess that I ""needed to take that table cause she wasn't going to put up with them tonight"" despite them not being sat in my section. 

I didn't care that was just more tips for me. 

Anyway, I immediately realize why my lazy coworker hated them. They were indeed ""needy"" but not in a bad way. The man was eccentric. He wanted to be shown the dessert tray before he ordered anything because in his words ""I like to plan accordingly"". They were really friendly and sweet and wanted to chat with you. They usually had a bunch of questions about wine and ingredients. They always wanted to try beers and such before they ordered and when he did order he wanted us to put his plates and coffee cups in the oven to heat them before hot foods were put in them. All of this was tiring to do and if you were really busy his table would easily put you in the weeds however that night after I jumped through flaming hoops to give them great service he handed me the check said they had a great time and they'd see me next week. I opened that check and it had a 50 dollar tip. 

Here is the kicker when they came back in next week, my coworker almost tripped over herself getting to the hostess to make sure they were sat in her section. She came to the back pissed just to inform me that they had requested that I wait on them. They became almost weekly regulars and only on days that I worked. They never left less than 40 bucks and I had all their ""needy"" quirks down to a science so they never put me behind if we got busy.

&lt;p&gt;She also tries to do something that usually only the hosts/servers do, and I called her out on that too and she again got upset, saying that I&amp;#39;m telling her how to do her job.  Well, I kind of have to because you can&amp;#39;t do something as simple as buss properly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s also kind of creepy (comments on my butt all the time, for example) and just tries to get all the attention on her.  She says she gets 10 minute breaks, which she takes like...every hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just hit my breaking point that day in dealing with her.  Maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t get so frustrated&amp;quot; but I&amp;#39;m tired of seeing her eating food while I&amp;#39;m working my ass off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, I had two guests the same day tell me that I&amp;#39;m the best server they&amp;#39;ve ever had :)&lt;/p&gt;

As stated in one of my earlier posts, I work at a pizza place as a cashier, and have done so for about six months now. The job can get hectic at times, but it's never felt as though anything was beyond our control. Well, not until today at least. Be sure to get comfortable, because this is going to be a long one. 

It was about eight o'clock at this point, and the entire staff is already on edge from either one thing or another. My coworker and I had gotten stiffed on a 400 dollar order (we agreed to split the tip with the kitchen staff if we got one), and we were understaffed for tonight. One of my manager's sent home another of my coworkers home early because there wasn't a need for three cashiers on shift. We didn't mind because the counter would be less crowded and we could earn more tips, but this came back to bite us in the ass later on. 

I had to man the front counter on my own while the other cashier did a couple deliveries. We were severely behind, and had to extend our turnaround time for all orders just to keep up with the crowd. Most people are actually pretty patient, and will just sit tight and relax if you give them an estimate on when their order will be ready or when it'll arrive to their home; but one customer didn't seem to get the memo. 

I received a call from an angry, concerning the fact that she placed an order an hour ago, and that it hadn't arrived yet. This was before we got extra swamped, so they were told it'd arrive in only forty five minutes. I told them that I couldn't give an accurate estimate on when it'd arrive, but only that all three drivers were out and that they'd be at their residence as soon as possible. 

This wasn't enough for them, however, and she complained that their staff were hungry (it was an office building) and that they had been promised a 45 minute delivery time. I explained to them that the delivery time changes with the influx of orders, and that everyone was working as fast as they could. Even so, they still insisted I that I gave them some sort of time frame for when it would arrive. Using the GPS system on the register, I realized the location was down the same route I use to drive to class each day, and I gave them an estimated time of twenty minutes. 

The woman was still annoyed told me that the office would close at 8:15. This was the first time we'd been told about this, and I explained that there was nothing I could do. She angrily hung up and I assumed that was the last of it. *Boy, was I wrong.* 

We receive another call from the same office building, but from a different woman. It was the same situation--trying to argue with me, acting impatient, etc. and I was beginning to become frustrated. She was cursing me out and demanding that I had the manager speak with her, and wouldn't believe me whenever I told her that he wasn't there (we have multiple managers at our restaurant, and they're out quite a lot to focus on other work, so a lot of communication is relayed over call or text). 

By now, a line of patiently waiting customers was forming, and I was running out of options. I decided to cut my losses and said I'd find someone she could talk to. Of course, it didn't matter who she talked to, but I just needed an excuse to get off the phone and help the other customers. I put her on hold and (regrettably) slammed the receiver.

Just as I hit my breaking point, the customer at the front of the line placed a few dollars in the tip jar and applauded me for standing up to her. I quickly apologized for my behavior and for keeping her waiting, but she shrugged it off and said that it was all good. The woman on the phone didn't bother waiting, and hung up while I was in the middle of taking the order. Once again, I thought that the nightmare was over. 

The other cashier returned from his delivery, and quickly took a call once he had returned the keys and the delivery bag. *Do I really need to say who the call was from?*   

A few minutes later my coworker, now bright red and shaken up, asked me what I had said to her. I explained what happened, and he said that he was ready to clock out and head home for tonight, since this was the last straw on an already brutal shift. He eventually calmed down and helped me power through the all the closing work. The driver recently returned from delivering to the office building, and he had told us that the woman told her colleagues not to tip him, but everything else had otherwise gone smoothly. They also had asked him what he status of the delivery would be, and apparently he had also given them a twenty minute time stamp. 

Everyone was pretty beaten up and discouraged by the end, and just wanted to go home. Fortunately, one of managers had come in to check up on us before we closed, and we told him about the entire situation. Thankfully, he was very understanding about the whole thing. He said he knew that we were all doing our best and that we had just been overwhelmed. He also told us that he'd call the customer tomorrow and apologize for the long wait as damage control.

Overall, the entire staff went home feeling pretty burnt out. I can't help but feel partially responsible for letting the situation become so out of hand, but what's done is done I suppose.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today had been the busiest day of the entire year (at the time of writing), but it had been plagued by one incident after another.

Luckily i serve at a mom &amp; pop vegan filipino restaurant so a majority of my tables are friendly, always have nice things to say, and love the food. Every now and again however there'll be that table or that one person that finds the smallest thing to bitch about.

On my shifts i'm the only server during the evenings and we can usually handle the business on our own so there really is no hostess that's necessarily needed (however that would be nice). Karen comes into the picture and doesn't say a word when she comes in and sits herself at a 4 top which i don't really mind bc later in the night it does get slow but c'mon, at least great your server..

Everything is fine until the bill comes. We have a new POS that has a 4% service fee and the reactions from customers are usually chill about it. I mean, as far as i'm concerned, that's a typical thing i see vendors doing with credit card sales. it is however something i dont think the customers should be paying in the first place but I digress. I tell Karen about the additional service fee to make sure it's okay with her and she gave me a look like i just shit in her food. Her response was ""where does it say that"" in which i point to a sign on the window. I gotta deal with the fit she threw after the fact and tried reasoning with her however she just wasn't having it.

&lt;p&gt;Luckily i serve at a mom &amp;amp; pop vegan filipino restaurant so a majority of my tables are friendly, always have nice things to say, and love the food. Every now and again however there&amp;#39;ll be that table or that one person that finds the smallest thing to bitch about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my shifts i&amp;#39;m the only server during the evenings and we can usually handle the business on our own so there really is no hostess that&amp;#39;s necessarily needed (however that would be nice). Karen comes into the picture and doesn&amp;#39;t say a word when she comes in and sits herself at a 4 top which i don&amp;#39;t really mind bc later in the night it does get slow but c&amp;#39;mon, at least great your server..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is fine until the bill comes. We have a new POS that has a 4% service fee and the reactions from customers are usually chill about it. I mean, as far as i&amp;#39;m concerned, that&amp;#39;s a typical thing i see vendors doing with credit card sales. it is however something i dont think the customers should be paying in the first place but I digress. I tell Karen about the additional service fee to make sure it&amp;#39;s okay with her and she gave me a look like i just shit in her food. Her response was &amp;quot;where does it say that&amp;quot; in which i point to a sign on the window. I gotta deal with the fit she threw after the fact and tried reasoning with her however she just wasn&amp;#39;t having it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all of this, i take her payment and to no surprise, no tip. $67.00 bill, and no tip. If there was an issue with service I would totally understand the no tip but seriously? For something that I have no control over? &lt;/p&gt;

She apologizes for the meal being bad (even though they ate 99% of it) and comps it. My aunt (uncle's wife) is the head host there and we both look at each other and shake our heads figuring that would be the end of it.

The next Friday night, same 2 guys come in, same story, same FoH manager, same result. Happens a 3rd time the following Friday. At this point my aunt has had it (rightly so), so clues uncle into what's going on and he arranges to work the front of house the Friday after.

Again they eat their ""bad"" meal, then tell the server to get the manager over. I can see my uncle basically salivating right now at this.

They look surprised when he arrives at their table &amp; not the front of house manager. My uncle listens to their story, but then says ""well it can't have been the worst meal ever since you barely left any scraps of it.""

You can seem them turning pale white knowing the gig is up. Suddenly, the meal wasn't so bad, but they didn't bring their wallets. So uncle says ""well in that case, I can get the police over here and get you for being a dine &amp; dasher, but you wouldn't want that now would you?"" Magically they found their wallets &amp; as my uncle leaves them, he says ""make sure you tip your server good tonight.""

My aunt and I nearly wet ourselves laughing at this. They left and we never saw them again. I did see the server thank him later, so I guess they took his advice. Just great to see how without throwing blame, until they couldn't find their wallets, he guilt tripped them out.

Somehow I forgot to put in one of my tables food and it had already been some time when I realized it. My stomach literally sank into my ass and if you serve, you know exactly the feeling I’m talking about. 

So, I grab my manager and told her I fucked up and to please rush the ticket. I went to the table and let them know what happened and I apologized like twenty times. They couldn’t have been nicer which made me feel even worse. I kept saying sorry as food was coming out and it was taking what felt like forever. Finally it came out and the lady let me know that she had ordered 10 boneless and not the 5 that came to the table. I still had the order and I wrote down 5, so not sure where that miscommunication happened, but whatever, it was fine and I got them right out. 

I got my manager to come their appetizer and I gave them a free dessert so they were all good.

Finally I got them the check, they paid and left. When I went to pick up the check I realized that I gave them someone else’s credit card slips. They literally didn’t even say anything to me since they probably felt bad that I was so fucking stupid. They ended up just signing the itemized receipt in an attempt to not shame me further.

We went to a restaurant known for their yummy pancakes.

Soon after we were seated, the servers put together about 6 tables for 2 large groups. The first group had one older couple, a slightly older mom with a well behaved baby, a single mom with another well behaved baby. The second group had two couples and another single mom with six devil spawn between them. 

The first 3 sat together, ate, talked calmly, and obviously knew the other 3 families, but were definitely not like them in any way.

The second group rarely even sat down. The moms at least stood up the whole time, talking loudly, yelling at the kids, chasing after them, or just standing around talking to each other like they were at a party. They were completely oblivious to the other diners around them that were trying to eat and hold their own conversations.

The kids were running all around the restaurant, yelling and screaming. They kept jumping onto the long back booth (where they were not seated) and jumping up and down like it was a trampoline. One boy kept taking his shirt off, and his mom proudly said loud enough for us all to hear that usually he takes his pants off. 

I guess at some point the kids actually ate in shifts, because the 2 dads got ready to go. Mom and dad 1 left with their 2 screaming children. Dad 2 with 3 boys, including Mr. I Take My Clothes Off, decided it was time to leave.

First they go running at full steam through the entire restaurant. Then Dad 2 keeps them in the waiting area for a while, while they scream blood curdling screams like someone is murdering them. 

All this time, Mom 2 and single mom, with heathen child 6 on her hip, are inches from our table as they decide to have long conversations with the nice group.

Dad 2 gets tired of waiting in the restaurant and goes out to the car, parks it right in front of our window so it’s facing his woman (but her back is turned as she’s deep in some trashy conversation). He lets his 3 heathen boys go hog wild on the window, rocks, and plants for 20 FREAKING MINUTES while he flashes his headlights in our face over and over again, just to get his wife to leave. 

By this point, our poor waitress has retrieved her tip. Nosy me asked- $7 on a $90 bill. So- we left her $25 on our $40 ticket to try to make up for this nightmare of a table, give her a hug, get our pancakes in a to go box, and leave.

I gave Dad 2 a dirty look as I walked out. It took everything I had not to say a word to these people.

Thanks to all of you servers for dealing with shitty families like this, night after night, and still going back the next day. 

You deserve so much better.

So I get through the entire bar before happy hour and every single person has been given last call for happy hour. Yes even Karen. 
 
Well 20 minutes after I'm still pretty busy and she starts smacking the bar and doing the yoohoos. 

Karen: "" Can I still get happy hour?""
 
Me: ""No mam happy hour was over 20 minutes ago""
 
She smacks the bar but I just assume shes annoyed with herself and move on. 
 
Out of nowhere I hear ""I'm hot""
 
Now mind you I'm just assuming that she's complaining to her friends. Also note it's not at all hot. Its actually pretty cool. 
 
Then a louder ""I'm hooooot""
 
Now everyone in the bar is looking at her. 
 
I go over and ask her if I can help her. 
 
"" yeah I'm hot can you turn on the AC?""
 
"" Im sorry mam we always keep the thermostat at 70""
 
""ARENT YOU HOOOOT?""
 
"" No actually I'm a little chilly mam""
  
I move on because we all know there is nothing I can do to help her.

So I work in a family owned shop in an office and residential building downtown that serves fusion food. Was just another day, serving up the lunch crowd of office workers and university students going to the new campus branch that was recently established here. After things slowed down past the lunch rush, a tall man with a medium build dressed in a plain white t-shirt and track shorts comes in.

He explains to me that he works at a local call center and that he and his co-workers usually place a large order ""every Thursday, later in the afternoon"" and that he had recieved the wrong protein in his noodle stirfry last week which should have been shrimp and not beef. He claims that another person had told him that in exchange for the mix-up that they would comp his next order.

Immediately this seems suspicious to me. As I mentioned, the shop is family owned and the only people who operate it are my mother, my father, my sister, my grandmother and me. It's more often than not all of us working the shop together at any given time of day, my old man and my grandma in the kitchen while me, sis, and ma handle the front, and for the past months I had no recollection of any group of people calling in any large orders during the late afternoon on Thursdays.

I ask both my mother and sister if they have any recollection of any sort of large phone order around that time last week to get some form of confirmation. Both deny ever receiving any such order.

I then ask them if they have some sort of receipt or order number so we can check our system to see if any such order had been made. He tells me he doesn't have either, it was one of his co-workers who handled the pick-up.

At this point I tell him that if he cannot provide any proof of purchase that I am unable to provide him with a replacement for the meal he had claimed was prepared wrong the week prior, and that neither my mother, sister, or me remember even receiving this order.

Was at this point that all doubt that he was trying to pull a fast on us was thrown out the window. He immediately became indignant and began to shout at us repeatedly that he and his co-workers at the call center order ""EVERY THURSDAY"" and that we were a bunch of ""CHEAP *insert heinous racial slur for asian americans here*"" for not giving him a free meal meant to replace one he never even paid for.

We attempted to diffuse the situation, though he continued to behave unreasonably, and in a fit of anger he tore open the door to the drink cooler and began to lob cans of soda at me.

My old man, who came out of the kitchen when he began to shout, phoned the building's security officers to try and do something about the guy, who ran out the instant he saw him reach for the phone.

He was long gone before anything could be done, but afterwards we did file a police report regarding the incident, security camera feed was able to capture the whole thing, thankfully.

Got a bruise on my forehead, but nothing bad.

I'm a manager at a high end steak house/bar.  We are newly opened (not even 3 months old yet) so we are still working out some bugs.  But, I have the greatest staff and customers....so far.

We are starting to get ""regulars"" and most of them are great.  But, just last night we started noticing a trend with one guy.

His name is actually Chris but, he is one of ""those customers"".  
He use to own a bar/restaurant, he use to be a chef, he use to work for a food broker... he is the type of person that has been there and done that. But, when he did it, he did it bigger, better and more bad ass than anyone else.  And all of his stories get more elaborate and far fetched by the day and how much he has had to drink.
I'm waiting on the day he tells us he was chef for the Pope on the flight to Mars to met Elvis.

Anyway.... our every Thursday special is prime rib. So, we noticed he is there often but, has yet to miss the prime rib special.
After several of the servers and one other manager put all their heads together with me we also noticed that no matter who takes care of him he always complains about something.

So, last night we were ready but, he still blew or mind.

Me=me  C=customer Chris

Me- Welcome back! What can I get for you today?
C- Thanks! I'm ready for some of that amazing prime rib 
Me- Great! I'll be right back with your side salad and drink
C- acts like he is happy and all is well
Me-brings drink and salad and give the kitchen a few minutes to plate up the prime rib
C-finishes 1st cocktail and salad
Me-I bring new drink then beautiful plate of food
C-this looks great thank you

I then give the customary 3 minutes and go back to check on him

Me-how's that prime rib
C- well if it was prime rib it would be great
Me- WHAT?
C- yeah...this is sirloin 
WTF?!?!.... This guy has to be kidding!
Me- let me go talk to the kitchen 

I go ask the chef (great guy, really knows his stuff)
He laughs so hard he has to sit down! 
He then shows me the whole prime rib he is slicing from and assured me that it is not sirloin.
He then comes out of the kitchen to talk to Chris.

Chris argues with the chef about the cut of meat and how he cant believe that we would hire a chef that didn't know the difference in meat.

Chef gets pissed and goes back to the kitchen with the plate.  He then takes the original prime rib, trims fat, covers with gravy and replates the meat.  Chef delivered the plate back to Chris and waits with me on a response.

C- oh wow! This is perfect!
Me- glad we could fix it
C- chef this is much better... I'm glad I could help you see your mistakes
Chef-fuming, leaves and swears to drop Chris's food on the floor before serving next time.

Chris finished his food, has more drinks, tells bad stories to anyone that will listen, orders dessert, complains about dessert, sits for more than 3 hours drinking and telling stories. 
Even talks to a neighbor table, telling them to ""make sure their prime rib is the right cut"".
Finally leaves without tipping but, instead saying  ""See you next time"".

To start, some basic info for context, I work in fast food and was on the last day of my work week before a well deserved day off, and this occurred the day before Hurricane Dorian hit.

It was busy, and I was working drive-thru. Had served a customer their order, and went to hand them a straw for their drink and some napkins (our store doesn't want those items in the bag with the food, due to a complaint a while ago). So we get through the rush of people, and I am working on cleaning up my store, when the store phone rings... I had spare time, and so sent a co-worker to finish up what little cleaning was left and answered the phone, and the conversation went roughly like this.

(Note: each paragraph is someone else's dialogue, as I'm unsure if scripts with labels are against the rules, so the first starts with me)

""Hello, [Fast Food], OP speaking, how may I help you?""

 ""Yeah, I was just through your drive-thru and the guy working there messed up my order""

""I'm so sorry about that, what was it you ordered?""

""I ordered a double burger, fries and a drink.""

 ""And what did you receive?""

 ""A triple burger, fries and a drink""

 (I take a moment to note that this guy is complaining about paying for a double burger, and getting a triple burger, but I decide to continue)

""Okay, so is that the only -""

 ""No! Your server at the window just stood there taking orders while my food sat on the window sill,""

 ""Okay-""

 ""And he didn't give me a fucking straw, so I can't drink my drink, and if I look in the bag- oh look at that, NO NAPKINS! So I can't wipe off my face or hands.""

 (It's at this point I realize that this guy doesn't know that I was the guy who had served him, and I realize that this was the guy who drove off before I could give him a straw and napkins)

""Sir, I'm sorry this happened-""

 ""Well sorry doesn't fix my order now does it? You need to do something with that guy in the drive-thru, either retrain him or fire him, because he's *clearly* too stupid to know what he's doing.""

 (At this point, I'm fed up, a little hurt because he's talking about me, and overall just done with this conversation, so I just ask for the guy to hold on a moment, and explain the problem to my supervisor... he just told me to inform the guy that the manager would be here in the morning to help him)

""Sorry, but the manager of the store will be in tomorrow morning, so if you want to call back tomorrow morning then the manager can help you""

 (I only hear silence and assume he's gone, and so I just hang up)

Now, I found out through a text from my manager that our store wasn't opening the next day due to the hurricane, and I explained to them the situation with the dude on the phone, and they laughed.

Nothing came of it though, and as far as I know, the guy hasn't been back yet.

The person I responded to had made a post bemoaning that tipping is a scam, and they're essentially being ripped off. It's a bit long winded but that's because I didn't feel an oversimplified explanation would help someone that has an oversimplified idea of just what goes into our jobs, and how much they actually benefit from having the system in place.

&gt;I think the paradigm shift that we're seeing come from the fact that roughly half of every American food dollar goes towards eating out. Eating at a restaurant used to be a luxury. People cooked meals at home.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm not that old, and I've seen a substantial change in my lifetime. Meals at home were the norm. We went out to a restaurant maybe once a month. Three to four times a month we would get fast food, or order in.  
&gt;  
&gt;Eat out once or twice a day, and the experience no longer seems special. We've basically come grown to feel entitled to these services now that they are financially within our reach. Could you afford to hire a maid, a butler, or a personal assistant?  
&gt;  
&gt;You can walk in with a stained shirt, wrinkled jeans, and order a server around like you're the King of England.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tipping is a scam. It's a scam that works in your favor. See the mistake on your part is the belief that you have simplified the job down to ""the person who brings food"". A farmer grows and picks crops. A musician walks on stage and sings songs. People who don't have any experience in these fields have the knowledge equivalent of a child's cartoon of what goes into to the respective fields.  
&gt;  
&gt;When you're serving, you are managing the needs of more than one person. In most restaurants, that's typically a 3 or 4 table section. That can easily be 24 people at once. You're not operating on your whims and your schedule. You're operating on the customer's. Imagine, one table is ready for their check. You're at another table. This person can't decide what they want to eat. Another person, is asking for every customization under the sun. The other table keeps sending you for one item at a time. You just came back with napkins. They want more bread. You bring the bread. They've finished their soda. You come back. They forgot to ask for extra ranch. Your fourth table is trying to order things that aren't on the menu. Insisting that you have it. Insisting that they know better than you. Asking why the cook can't just make it.  
&gt;  
&gt;You're at the whims of their moods, temper, attitude, varying levels of hangry. People who think it's okay to grab your ass. People who have learned that if you complain enough a lot of managers will comp items or possibly the whole bill.  
&gt;  
&gt;You're managing needs, personalities, and above all time. Guess what? All that shit has to get done. It has to get done punctually too. Your wage could depend on it. That's just in the front. In the back, ice needs to be filled. Salad bar needs to be filled. Coffee needs to be made. Silverware needs to be polished and rolled. Straws and napkins need to be stocked.  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite all of that, the bottom line is, did you feel I did a satisfactory job. Did you get the experience that you wanted? Did you feel that you received value from my job? You can choose to pay me jack shit. You can feel that I did an excellent job and still choose to pay me jack shit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Don't take it as me whining about my job. I actually like it. I gave you a pretty shitty, yet realistic scenario. It's a crap shoot, and I receive a job performance from every person that comes in to dine with me. On top of that, I my job performance often factors in the success of the restaurant. It doesn't matter to the customer that I didn't cook the steak. It doesn't matter to the customer that the bartender took 10 minutes to make my drink.  
&gt;  
&gt;When you remove the scam of tipping, I'm no longer at your whim. I don't have to give you my best to get paid. A domino effect begins.  
&gt;  
&gt;If they are a good employer, they're going to raise the cost of food substantially to keep their employees well paid and working efficiently.  
&gt;  
&gt;If they are a bad employer, they're going to raise the cost of food substantially, and pocket the difference. They'll pay the employee minimum wage. Anybody worth a shit will quit. Those that stay, will give no fucks. You'll be paying $25 on a Friday night for a 6oz sirloin at Applebees brought to you by someone making McDonald's wages. Maybe you'll wait an hour and a half to get it because half the staff called off. What's the incentive to work a busy Friday night? In a tipped culture, restaurants already have a high turnover rate.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, try eating outside of the United States. It's a whole different ballpark. Free unlimited bread is an American thing. Large portions are an American thing. Free drink refills are an American thing. I've been to restaurants where the water isn't even free. The amount of freebies, specials, and coupons doled out by American restaurants to get you to come in and choose them is unheard of in many other places.  
&gt;  
&gt;You think you're being scammed when the truth is that you've become entitled to a lifestyle that most Americans likely couldn't afford if the system of tipping were eliminated. And the absolute fucked thing is that you somehow feel indignant over a system that clearly picked up your slack so that you can continue to enjoy that lifestyle.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the response below was a response I made in another subreddit.

I assumed more of his friends were coming so I just placed it in. At the same time, it was his own writing so i didnt think much. 

Once the 3 drinks arrived he told us that he didnt order them, which my colleague proceeded to show him the menu that he written. Kicked up a fuss, and rudely exclaimed that we had put it in just to get more profit. At this point my colleague just handed him the receipt while clarifying that we merely did what he ordered, that I only use a pen and that the handwriting matched the others. We have a 'once made no returns or swaps' policy so this was kind of a big deal. It was 3 big drinks.  The receipt showed the drinks so I obviously wouldnt have tampered w his order right after (adding in drinks afterwards then forcing him to pay for extra)

Right afterwards he literally stfu'd and told us (rudely) that he will swap them to some other drinks after theyre done eating. Manager let it as he didnt want to escalate it. After all that was settled and as he was leaving my colleague happened to be standing at the exit, so she went 'have a nice day sir! :)' and i could see that he had lost face and embarassingly said uh huh. Best moment there.

Look boo. If it was a mistake you made, i dont mind going out of my way to refund it, even if manager may not be impressed.

&lt;p&gt;Once the 3 drinks arrived he told us that he didnt order them, which my colleague proceeded to show him the menu that he written. Kicked up a fuss, and rudely exclaimed that we had put it in just to get more profit. At this point my colleague just handed him the receipt while clarifying that we merely did what he ordered, that I only use a pen and that the handwriting matched the others. We have a &amp;#39;once made no returns or swaps&amp;#39; policy so this was kind of a big deal. It was 3 big drinks.  The receipt showed the drinks so I obviously wouldnt have tampered w his order right after (adding in drinks afterwards then forcing him to pay for extra)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right afterwards he literally stfu&amp;#39;d and told us (rudely) that he will swap them to some other drinks after theyre done eating. Manager let it as he didnt want to escalate it. After all that was settled and as he was leaving my colleague happened to be standing at the exit, so she went &amp;#39;have a nice day sir! :)&amp;#39; and i could see that he had lost face and embarassingly said uh huh. Best moment there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look boo. If it was a mistake you made, i dont mind going out of my way to refund it, even if manager may not be impressed. But the moment you accuse us wait staff of ill intent and be rude about it, you just lost my sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;

Their total was $38, and they paid with card. The paying man paying handed me a $5 directly.

He moved the $5 away from the tip jar and said “Oh, I’m not feeling that generous tonight.” 

It took a second for his comment to dawn on me. As he kept dangling the five from his limp, cowardly wrist, I asked “Did you....want me to break this into change?”

His buddy laughed and he said “Yeah, that would be great!”

Her dad came to the store and cussed him out in front of everyone. Not sure how to link to the last post. 

The manager and girl were both fired. 

Our DM and the guy above him(his boss) came down and interviewed a lot of us about the incident. We all said it was just a joke but they still fired him because managers should not joke like that.

Now for the girl. I’m actually not sure if she quit or if she’s fired. I’m going with fired because the GM took her off the schedule and isn’t putting her back on.

This is what happened. Today the girl called before her shift and said she was in talks with another store. She wasn’t going to come in unless our GM gave her what she wanted. This other store was going to give the girl 35 hours. She only gets like 20 hours here. 

The girl said if our GM gives her 35 hours and a raise, she will stay with us. The GM said she’s not giving her the hours or the raise. 

The reason for the hours is because this girls parents would come up here all the time during her shift and demand that she be let off the clock. We’ll be slammed and her parents will just take her out of here and leave us short handed. That’s with 20 hours. Her parents won’t even let her work the hours she gets, there’s no way they’re going to let her work extra.

The reason she isn’t getting the raise is because it isn’t time for her evaluation. 

So the girl and her parents got mad and said they’re just going to go with the other store. Our GM said that’s fine and wished her luck, then she took the girl off the schedule.  She said she isn’t going to beg the girl to stay. 

Honestly I think the girl thought she was hot shit since she got the manager fired and she probably thought everyone would kiss her ass now. She’s not a great worker and she sucks at window so the GM isn’t broken up at all over it. 

Looks like that’s the end of it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manager jokingly told employee he would punch her in the face. Her dad came to the store and cussed him out in front of everyone. Not sure how to link to the last post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manager and girl were both fired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our DM and the guy above him(his boss) came down and interviewed a lot of us about the incident. We all said it was just a joke but they still fired him because managers should not joke like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the girl. I’m actually not sure if she quit or if she’s fired. I’m going with fired because the GM took her off the schedule and isn’t putting her back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what happened. Today the girl called before her shift and said she was in talks with another store. She wasn’t going to come in unless our GM gave her what she wanted. This other store was going to give the girl 35 hours. She only gets like 20 hours here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl said if our GM gives her 35 hours and a raise, she will stay with us. The GM said she’s not giving her the hours or the raise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for the hours is because this girls parents would come up here all the time during her shift and demand that she be let off the clock. We’ll be slammed and her parents will just take her out of here and leave us short handed. That’s with 20 hours. Her parents won’t even let her work the hours she gets, there’s no way they’re going to let her work extra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason she isn’t getting the raise is because it isn’t time for her evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the girl and her parents got mad and said they’re just going to go with the other store. Our GM said that’s fine and wished her luck, then she took the girl off the schedule.  She said she isn’t going to beg the girl to stay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like that’s the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;

On mobile, TLDR at bottom. Usual stuff. 

I work at a small restaurant, and every day of the week we have different specials. Thursday is Curry Night. 

Starting a few months ago we attracted the attention of a local neighborhood man. Big curry fan, apparently. He comes in, orders his chicken curry and complains that we 'forgot' to give him his free birthday dessert the week before. 

1. I worked the week before, and don't remember this man. 

2. No one told me the week before it was their birthday. 

3. We don't give free birthday desserts on take out orders anyway. 

But whatever. I didn't feel like arguing it, so we sent him off with an apology and a free dessert. 

He does this regularly. Every week he comes in for his curry and complains in an attempt to get something free. He's gotten a free appetizer, 10% off, free side of naan, free extra rice. No more. 

He came in tonight. Ordered his chicken curry and mentioned he was given no vegetables the week before. This. Is. Impossible. Even on our busiest nights there's no way we would forget one of the three components to a dish. It's curry, rice, and vegetables. There's no f*cking way. 

We were insanely busy tonight when he came in, and when he complained about the no veggies I ignored it completely. This upset him, so he decided to make my night as hard as possible. He demanded I keep running to fetch him ""colder water"", frequently shouting at me from across the room even though I was busy with other customers. Any time I tried to serve someone else, he called me back to remind me that he wants his curry ON his rice, not beside it. It HAD to be on top. 

Then to top it all off, I let him know his order would be out next and it was just getting bagged up to go. I ran to the kitchen to collect it for him, and when I returned he was gone. So I left the food where he was sitting and carried on with serving the others. 

He came back 15 minutes later, grabbed his food and left. 

I expect next week he'll be complaining about his food having been cold. And you know what? I already let the owner know, and the next time he's in the owner is going to speak to him personally. 

Do people really do this regularly? I can understand if someone does this at a bunch of restaurants once, but coming back every Thursday for the same dish with a different complaint in an attempt to get a deal? Have you no shame?

My bar/restaurant is a little dive bar a street over from the ocean specializing in seafood and keeping a bar packed full of regulars every single night. But let me get to the part that matters, why I have the best restaurant in the history of restaurants to work in.

We have 4 co-owners, 3 of which I have never met and literally only show up to bring the cooks ice cream or serve a few tables on nights we’re absolutely too slammed - and then give the servers all the tips they earned that night helping us out. The one co owner I see regularly though, he’s the shit. He bartends a few morning shifts for us a week and is always smiling, buying us rounds of shots, cooking crazy foods in the back for us servers to share, checking up on us, if we come in a little under the weather he goes out of his way to make sure we’re okay and feeling good enough to serve our tables. 

Our bar manager is the nicest woman I have ever met and routinely offers to help me with my college math classes when we slow down late at night, buys the servers rounds, gives us control of the jukebox, routinely locks the doors and we all get drunk and jam to 80’s rock and early 2000’s boybands. 

Our side work is so that we all pool together and no one ever has to stay more than 15 minutes past the last customer to close up.

The cooks and servers get along like I have NEVER seen before. Our cooks and servers smoke joints in the back of the kitchen and come up with crazy stuff all the time, and even being in a bible belt state our main owner never minds or comments on it.

You’re late? Cool, show up whenever, we’ve got a fish taco and a shot waiting on you. 

Bad breakup? No worries, stay home, recover and getcha head in the game but until then, one of the owners is more than happy to come in for your shifts.

I’m just getting into the restaurant industry. I’d like to go into how I got the job first to maybe give a little bit of context on the kind of person I am first.  If you don’t want to read it I’ll leave some pointers as to where it ends. 

[start of back story]

So, every year I went out to eat to this all American styled smokehouse (I’m from the UK and where I’m from there’s not many) and I absolutely LOVE this place. And I was out of a job and a few days after my birthday meal I noticed they were hiring. And in my mind I was dead set about getting this job. 

I have social anxiety so a lot of the people around me were telling me not to go for this job as I’ll struggle to talk to so many people. 

Regardless I went for the interview, met with one of the managers and had a good chat about the restaurant and exactly why I chose this place. A few days go by and I get a call saying they’d like to offer me a trial shift. So I get really pumped up about this. But my trial shift was a disaster let me tell you. I was nervous about everything I was completely out of my element I was messing up pretty much everything. But, I got on with the staff really well, especially the ones assigned to look after me at that night and I left feeling that it was still a good opportunity. 

Though the next day I get the phone call telling me I wasn’t successful at getting the job. I was actually pretty heartbroken about hearing this as of course it’s my favourite place to go to and working there would have been amazing. On the phone I lost my words so I just say the normal oh well thank you for the opportunity and the call ended. 

So around 4a.m that night with was just having the feeling like this wasn’t the way it was meant to go so I wrote an email to one of the managers asking for feedback and if possible a second try if the position wasn’t filled already.  

To my surprise the manager that I did my interview with emailed me back thanking me for asking for feedback. He said the position had been filled but they were willing to give me another shot because they liked my determination. This time around I know I smashed it. I got on some meds to deal with my anxiety and I felt so at home with helping guests and co-workers alike, I knew this was exactly the role I wanted. But my training wouldn’t be started the start of October (oh hey that’s next week) so until then they went out of their way to give me some shifts as a busser and I can’t exclaim how appreciative I am as it gives me more opportunity to get used to the environment and the team alike and I’ve found how much I enjoy being a server and how fulfilling it feels as I’m naturally just someone who likes to help. 

[End of back story] 


So I’m nervous. I just want to be the best server I can for this place and I’d appreciate any tips you guys can give! I’ve learnt to carry a semi full tray of drinks but still not the most confident. And the shoes I bought for the role leave me with blisters every shift no matter how much I try  and wear them down. 

And ya boi’ is a sweaty dude so when I start sweating I start panicking. One thing I gotta know is, is it as noticeable as I think it is lol?

I didnt mind at first, but many of these people seem to be business professionals who at least project the image that they can afford a $2 cup of tea or coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They always come in, say they&amp;#39;ll order when they&amp;#39;re meeting party gets here. Then when the time comes nobody orders anything. I&amp;#39;ve tried confronting them restaurant server style, &amp;quot;Hello, how are you, may I grab you a drink?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

Probably one of my favorite server stories. 

I was working at a brewpub in Oregon, and was taking tables on the patio. It was an INCREDIBLY busy day, and the kitchen was well behind, while also being understaffed. Knowing ticket times were high, I always let my tables know that food was probably going to take at least 30 minutes, possibly longer. Being a popular place, people never usually had an issue with that. Well, one horrible lady and her poor daughter came in, and after telling her it would be a while for food she said “I GUESS we can wait if we have to”. So, about 30 minutes go by, she’s had a few beers and her daughter is coloring. I already brought them a FREE plate of veggies and cheese with ranch, and checked back in to make sure drinks were still good. This lady just flips a switch and freaks out yelling about how she can’t believe food is taking so long and this is unacceptable, did I forget to put their food in, etc. I assure her I recently checked on her food(which I did) and that she was only 3 tickets from the front so they were currently cooking it. She continues to throw a tantrum about the wait, I apologize and offer her and her daughter both a free dessert, that she denies. “Well that will probably take another 30 minutes won’t it!”. 

The lady is so angry, I think partially because I’m still just being so nice to her, she says “we are leaving!” And she pulls her daughter up and they walk out. Literally 5 minutes later their food is done. I even tried to ask her if I could get their food Togo since it was almost done and she refused! All of this happened with the owner of this local brewpub sitting at the table right next to her. 

When I told my husband what happened he was pissed that the owner didn’t help me or stand up for me at all, or at least took over the issue. While the owner was technically not working and out to eat with some friends, I couldn’t believe he just sat there. My husband and I plan to own a restaurant in the future and if that happened to any of my workers I would immediately step in! The owner, later, found me in the kitchen and told me how well I handled the situation and gave me a $15 gift card to the restaurant(thanks?). I also got really good tips from the tables that saw it lol. After 10+ years in this industry that is actually the only time I have ever been screamed at, so I feel fortunate!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: sorry about crappy mobile layout&lt;/p&gt;

I work in one of the two dish pits in a 24 hour cafe/cafeteria in \[Redacted\]. We've got day shift (5/6am - 3/4pm) and a night shift (5pm-4am). The front dish pit is for any and all plastic (your cutting boards, cambros, lexans, small wares, and cafe dishes) while the back dishpit I work in is for all the big metal (sheet trays, hotel pans, mixing bowls, etc). The back dishpit has a machine for sanitizing and a 3 comp sink. It's generally expected in the 9 months I've been here that whatever we don't finish on day shift, night shift will pick up as they are much less busy than we are in day shift.

The main problem has been going on for *months* at this point. I'm the first one in the metal dish pit at 6am and the last one to leave it at 2pm. When I leave, I clean everything up, stack whatever I wasn't able to finish neatly, clean the sinks, and leave. When I come in the next morning, the whole area is trashed, sinks full of dirty dishes soaking in cold water (our woks and cast iron rusting away...), half the metal is up front mixed in with everything else. So all in all, it takes me about half an hour to clean up their mess, then another 20-30 minutes to sort out what I'm supposed to take and get started. Night shift has also been using all our day shift's next-day-prepped food for their off-shift and ruining our menus because of it; they once ruined $500 worth of pork fucking our day shift chefs and our food cost over.

A couple weeks ago, we noticed more and more of the dishes I come into in the mornings is from the day before that I wasn't able to finish. We found out this week the two night shift dishwashers decided they aren't touching anything from day shift and only doing about an hour's worth of night shift dishes and then sleeping on their shift. So the last two weeks, I've been doing effectively 3 days' worth of work (the day before, the night before, and the day of) every day.

My supervisor and our cafe's head chef have had enough of it, I've had enough of it. Last night head chef and our general manager stayed late to talk to them. The night dish worked until chef and manager left, then stopped again.  The night manager flaked/ghosted on head chef's meeting he had scheduled with her and she doesn't answer my supervisor's emails at all. My supervisor and I have been documenting everything with photos (how I leave it vs how night shift leaves it) every day for 2 months now. For whatever reason, our general manager just *won't* do anything.

It's frustrating as hell that I'm expected to do 2-3 times more work than the two dudes on night shift, but for less money.

Seated in my DD's section, we were close to the entrance.  Her BFF was on hostess/to-go.

Couple comes in to pick up their to-go order.  They get their food and kind of look around.  They spot an empty table by the bar and start heading that way. 

BFF: excuse me? Did you need drinks to go with that? 

Guy: yeah, we're going to have a couple beers and eat our food.  

BFF:  pardon?

Gal: are you deaf?  We.  Are.  Going.  To. Take. Our. Food. In. There. And. Eat. While. Having. A. Beer. 

BFF: no.

Both Guy and Gal: WHAT? 

BFF: See, to-go means you get your food and you GO somewhere else to eat it.

Guy: *laughing* Yeah, we're kind of in a hurry so we thought it would be faster to just have our food ready, have a drink, and be at [place] by 730.

Gal: so, you know, move so we can eat.

BFF: I'm pretty sure I said NO.  The food can stay at hostess stand while you have a beer, but you're not eating out of to-go containers in my bar.  

Guy: that's BULLSHIT!

BFF: take it or leave it.

Both start yelling at her and by now, I have my phone out to call 911 for her since she is like another daughter to me.  Another customer has been recording since they came in. 

Gal picks up the bag of food and throws it on the ground, spilling everything.

Gal: now look, you have to remake it all.

BFF: no.  Leave.

Knowing this is going to get out of hand, I call 911, knowing at this time of day, there's always an officer patrolling the mall and will be there in a minute or two.  I told the dispatcher an unruly couple were causing a scene and refusing to leave.

Gal picked up some food off the floor and started throwing it at BFF.  She continued and was still doing so when the officers walked in.  

Which promptly got them both arrested.


ETA: so there seems to be a lot of confusion why they weren't allowed to eat their food in the bar.

1) we have really strict Board of Health here.  I don't know the whole ins and outs of it but somehow this falls under the same rules as bringing in food from another restaurant.  Not allowed.  If there's outside tables that are not considered part of the restaurant (patio seating is part of the restaurant) they could have sat there, but not in the restaurant.

2) all seats, except those at the bar, belong to a server.  Apps and drinks only at the bar, no full menu.  Those people were still going to cause work for the server. 

A) getting the beer from the bar.

B) napkins, real silverware, condiments, bussing, all on server.

C) little to no tip, but still have to tip out to bartender","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a server, but my daughter is.  I was tired last night and didn&amp;#39;t want to cook.  If I&amp;#39;m eating out, I might as well go where she works and let her or her BFF be the server and benefit from the tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seated in my DD&amp;#39;s section, we were close to the entrance.  Her BFF was on hostess/to-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple comes in to pick up their to-go order.  They get their food and kind of look around.  They spot an empty table by the bar and start heading that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BFF: excuse me? Did you need drinks to go with that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy: yeah, we&amp;#39;re going to have a couple beers and eat our food.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BFF:  pardon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gal: are you deaf?  We.  Are.  Going.  To. Take. Our. Food. In. There. And. Eat. While. Having. A. Beer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BFF: no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I should also mention BFF is a manager.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Guy and Gal: WHAT? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BFF: See, to-go means you get your food and you GO somewhere else to eat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy: &lt;em&gt;laughing&lt;/em&gt; Yeah, we&amp;#39;re kind of in a hurry so we thought it would be faster to just have our food ready, have a drink, and be at [place] by 730.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gal: so, you know, move so we can eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BFF: I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I said NO.  The food can stay at hostess stand while you have a beer, but you&amp;#39;re not eating out of to-go containers in my bar.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy: that&amp;#39;s BULLSHIT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BFF: take it or leave it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both start yelling at her and by now, I have my phone out to call 911 for her since she is like another daughter to me.  Another customer has been recording since they came in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gal picks up the bag of food and throws it on the ground, spilling everything.&lt;/p&gt;

They let me know they would be staying for the entire baseball game that was just starting. Said they had just eaten so all they wanted was a Diet Coke and after he hemmed and hawed over various drink prices, the husband settled on a Happy Hour can of domestic beer at $1.50 (this is crazy cheap for anyone not familiar with bar prices.)

Since they had informed me they’d be there for the whole game, I let Joe (yes I was on first name basis with Joe and Sally before the night was over) talk me into pre-buying a couple more beers at happy hour prices before it ended. Our regulars could easily kill 2-3 beers in that amount of time and I figured they’d be spending more money over the course of the night so I thought why not be nice and let him have a deal. 

Well, turns out that Diet Coke and those 3 $1.50 beers were all they ordered during their 3.5 hour stay. I joked with his stupid jokes. I chatted amiably with them both during commercials. Worked with them to choose 2 candy bars to munch on. Brought them wet naps when their fingers were sticky from chocolate. Hand carried them bowls of the self-serve free popcorn we offer. Refilled Sally’s drink. Gave her some cherries because he said she loved them. 

At one point Joe declared me a great bartender. When the game was winding down I even read them a bedtime story! As in a silly adult book disguised as a children’s book. Like a wholesomely raunchy story with a main character that shares my first name, since remember we’re on a first name basis now. Sally literally has actual tears of laughter streaming down her face. 

They collect themselves to leave, pay their $9.50 tab, and leave me a $2 tip. Knowing they didn’t pay full price for 3 rounds of drinks and after basically monopolizing me for 3.5 hours. The job isn’t totally about the money, but come on $1 apiece is all they thought that was worth?i swear I’m not friendly only to jack up tips; I genuinely like to have fun with people. Makes the night pass so much better. But the money is kind of a statement on the value of our service.

She likes it.



Too easy. My ignorant mind led me to believe. I thought I had just taken down a mid tier Karen with ease. But, the battle was not won. I failed to see the regeneration powers she possessed.

I felt bad because I was pretty hard on him but he has one more training shift (will be his 8th.....) and then hes on his own so I had to just throw him in or else he will never learn. Also he made me shit money tonight so I’m just bitter. I just don’t think he’s ready but that’s not my place to say I guess. 

He asked on his first day “so you really don’t know when you’ll be out of here every day???” And I laughed in his face
Yesterday at his 3 hours he said “k I’m done” and left
But today I made him stay until his last table was done and still he left right as soon as they paid. 

I’m curious to see how he will do on his own, having to clean and do sidework and stuff too. 
Oh and also he still can’t hold a tray of more than 4 drinks or a large tray with 2 dinner plates on it.

Oh and also he still can’t hold a tray of more than 4 drinks or a large tray with 2 dinner plates on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yikes&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve gone through 7 managers in six years and all of them have sucked in various degrees . Two months ago we went through a ginormous staff overhaul. 

To make a long story short the previous manager in collusion with a few staff members was stealing.  We got a new store manager, new head chef, new hostess and two new servers. 

Anyway the new manager is super nice she’s been great but honestly I’ve had a few managers start out nice but turn out crappy so I’ve been holding my breath. This occurred Monday afternoon.

So I swipe in and she pulls me to the side asking if I’d take a table of folks who are known to be assholes since the new server whose section they were in is easily frazzled. 

So I go up to them, smile start to ask what they wanted to drink. Now I’ve never served these folks but I’ve heard horror stories. It’s a woman and man in their late fifties to early  sixties.  He interrupts me, “don’t wanna hear your bs drinks ya charge an arm and a leg for! Just get us some damn water. I fake a smile and go grab them ice waters, I go back and he tells me their orders before I can even set the drinks down. I wrote down their order and repeat it back to them. 

I go out in their order and take my next table, not even five minutes later he’s snapping his fingers. I go over, the wife has a look like she smelled her own farts and she barks out, “how long it take to make a damn medium rare burger.” I let them know their order will be out soon and it’s only been five minutes.  Ten minutes later their burgers are done I take them out to them. He starts yelling, “why is this burnt I asked for medium!! “ I can’t even get a word in, before the wife gets up goes over to the manager and literally drags her over.  My manager is in shock this woman literally yetted her over.  “Fix this! This server is incompetent this is unacceptable.” All I heard over and over in my head is lemongrab from adventure time, “This is unacceptable!!!”

My manager looked at them both I was expecting her to give them a corporate carder comp their meal but nope she asked them to leave, at first they wouldn’t but when she threatened to get mall security (we are attached to a mall) they left vowing never to come back. 

My manager just patted me on the back and thanked me.

Yesterday my restaurant learned that the VP of operations would be coming to our restaurant for a visit. Everyone immediately began preparing the restaurant, cleaning every inch and making sure things were in order. 

This morning I walked in, and the host told me our GM(whom I really like), another locations GM, and the VP of operations was sat near my section and wanted a server to serve them lunch. I was immediately terrified but my GM assured I’d be fine. So I go up and do my normal schpeel and the VP goes “you don’t have to do that, just be yourself rather than going that extra mile for me, which usually ends up sounding fake anyways” so I feel instant relief and go about serving them. It was very low maintenance and he ended up tipped 25%. I was terrified for nothing I guess! 

During the dinner shift of my double, I had to train someone I trained yesterday as well. He was the lead server and was doing fine but my manager got a little mad that I was letting him do things on his own but whatever. You gotta swim. 

It was 7:30 on the dot, exactly 3 hours from when he started he goes “ok I’m done” and I was like uhhhhhhh .... he still had 2 tables that he dealt with the entire time who were still eating but I mean... whatever, who am I to say anything.. so I just let it be and finished up those tables who ended up both tipping 25%. Idk what he’s gonna do when he’s on his own! Yesterday he said to me “so you really don’t know when you’re going to be off work every day???” Lol sorry dude. Good luck lol

It was an interesting day but ended good. I’ve been really enjoying serving these last couple weeks and actually wanting to be there (which is odd for me lol)

Had to serve our VP of operations who I never met, and trained someone who definitely didn’t want to be there any longer than 3 hours. Interesting day","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting day&lt;/p&gt;

My resume is recently updated and tomorrow its getting sent off. But I'm getting immense second thought syndrome.Is it normal to have some guilty nagging feeling inside? 

This is my first legit serving job and I was keen on making a good first impression, busted my ass off in the first week of probation  and they even complimented me saying they never had such a strong and capable candidate ever before. Before I knew, I was given full time priority hours and appreciated me. But now it is a struggle coming in. Im no longer full time ( part time by my request before you guys think it was managements decision) and while my hours are still respected and was recognized as a Lead server, literally there are so many red flags apart of this job that makes me just sick. For one thing it is my head manager, they are a complete dim wit. Their behaviour has constantly driven customers out of the restaurent, so many times have I had people say "" the food and service is lovely, but your boss is the worst! I wish I could just yell at him for you!"" My other colleagues have told me that this has happened to them to. Another thing is my colleagues, practically one guy who sexually harasses me and demeans me, telling me I'm a bitch, suck my dick, let me love you,blah blah blah. It doesn't matter if Im silent or I try to tell him no, he just keeps doing it. I feel like walking around egg shells around him. There is no complaining about his behaviour and his disgusting mouth because he is a long time staff member and a personal friend of the management so it is completely useless. Hell I have and they tell me "" Oh that's how he is always like, he never means it"" But Im not his friend, I just fucking work with the guy and why is it my problem now that I have to tolerate? Why is he so normal and me complaining is seen as the problem? So I never complain because it would only mean more trouble for me and my hours. 

But the biggest aspect is that we are constantly understaffed and overworked.  I'm stretched too thin- we use to have the usual three servers Friday night but it got cut to two regardless of factual evidence to prove that it is less busy. Plus if you decide to prioritize lets say your education then you are seen as lazy in the eyes of management. One coworker doesn't see this serving gig as a huge priority in her life and mostly as a way to earn good cash as a student but other coworkers continually attack her for choosing her life over this place. There was a former summer server here, it was her first serving gig and they were still  not forgiving. Every little mistake was a grandiose turnoff and almost everyone here trashed her rather than help her. Yes it was hard to train her but she was such a nice person I really wanted to make it work and eventually she gotten better. However when she did leave she told me that one coworker, one who had uttered some really horrible and uncalled for remarks about her, had said nice things about me and that he was super nice. This is the same coworker that gets a free pass for harassment in the workplace. Major eye roll.

The pay wasn’t always amazing, but the job was easy, my coworkers were generally great, and the members I served were usually very friendly to the employees. 

The club had an area attached to the men’s locker room that had a full bar, 8 TV’s, tables to serve roughly 80-90 people, and people could also smoke cigars/cigarettes in the space. Only men were allowed in this area, except on Saturday nights or for reserved events. Typically, there was one bartender assigned to the area for the entire day. As you may imagine, this could be hectic having to manage that bar all by yourself throughout the day, as I’d work shifts sometimes up to 16 hours in this area. This club was a non-tipping club, we had an hourly rate + tip share, which generally meant lower than average pay for a server. However, if you were willing to work in this area, the members that frequented this bar were infinitely more like to tip you. So if you were willing to put with the shift and dealing with the members there, you could end up having a very profitable day. I think the most I made during a day between tips and my hourly pay was roughly $750-$800. 

One evening, I was working and serving a group of men, and they left that evening to go to a local casino. These men loved to gamble on golf, so this was pretty unsurprising that they’d frequent casinos. When they left, I didn’t think much of it, as them leaving meant I could close up shop for the night.

The next afternoon, I came back to serve them again. I remember walking in to work that morning and one of my supervisors came up to me and said: “you’re about to have an interesting day.” As I walked into my bar, I learned that one of the members had won $55,000 playing blackjack at the casino the night before. Apparently, he decided to bet $5,000 on a hand, which he had never done before. He proceeded to win 12 $5,000 hands in a row, lost a hand, then walked away from the table with a quick $55,000 profit and walked out of the casino with $60,000 in cash (including the $5,000 he originally bet). The group he was with proceeded to celebrate and drink all night, as expected. 

The next day, the member brought all of his winnings to the club, as one of his friend’s had a safe there to put it in. Why a member had a large spare safe in his golf locker, I’ll never know. So I see the group of men walk into my bar, with the lucky winner holding a safe filled with the $60,000 in cash inside. He then proceeds to open the safe, pull the cash out, rips the hands off of all the bills, throw the cash in the air and let $60,000 rain onto the floor of my bar. 

Part of me felt happy for him, as he’s always treated me well and I believe he’s a genuinely nice person. Part of me felt jealous as I was a broke college student, and I was watching a dozen grown men rolling around in 4 years of my college tuition on the floor. I decided to just roll with it, embrace the debauchery, and try to pump up the members and try to earn some tips. 

Eventually they grew tired of rolling in the cash, and the member who had won the money wanted to make sure he didn’t lose any of the cash. So I was asked to locate some rubber bands to re-pack the cash. I’ll never forget the look on my manager’s face when I asked for rubber bands, as this is an uncommon request from a bartender, and explained why I needed them. 

I brought the bands and proceeded to re-band the cash on my bar as several men watched me do it. After doing this, they recounted the money and confirmed all of the bills were still there. I’ll never forgot seeing more cash then I’ve ever seen in my life sitting 2 feet from my face. The winner could see in my eyes how absurd of a situation this was to me, and slipped a $100 bill out of the band and gave it to me as a tip as he put the cash back in the safe. He also opened a tab for all of his buddies, which racked up to be roughly $3,500. I’m not sure what the winner did with the rest of his winnings, or how he’s doing now, but I know I will never forget him or the events of that day for the rest of my life.

It was near where I live in a rather conservative rural village and the pay was shit but it was enough to support me while I was living at home. We got all kinds of regulars in, mostly from a pub that was next door to us. You'd get old guys who would get chips at 4 pm, go next door for a few pints, come back to the chippy smelling of beer and piss and get more food before we shut for the night. For the most part, I never minded the regulars, I even came up with nicknames for some in my head to make the shift go faster. 

There was one however who tested my last nerve more than any of the others. So for context, I'm openly gay and also a Hindu. I have an Om symbol (Hindu religion's symbol) tattooed on my wrist and just by speaking to me and my mannerisms I am not fooling anyone into thinking I'm straight. People would occasionally make comments here and there but nothing that would really sink in other than this one regular. He was part of the crowd who liked to flit between the pub and the chippy most evenings and no matter how busy we were he would refuse to be served by me and wait for the next server (a straight woman) to be available. I would naturally let him know that I was free to take his order the first few times I noticed this, thinking he must have not seen I was free for some reason. This was until one day he flat out made my coworker re-assemble a meal he had ordered because I had put some of it together. He stormed off with his food mumbling 'no batty boy is getting his hands near my food'. I was taken so far back but I was like okay, you're a piece of shit but you do you I guess.

This went on for months, he would wait for whichever server was working with me that night to be free before getting his order taken, and I would just zone it out. My boss knew about it but was pretty money-focused so never commented on it, his son was in charge when he wasn't there and he was silent about it too. 

So one day a few weeks before I was set to finish working there to move for uni, when I was already fresh out of fucks for working there Mr. Homophobia comes in on a busy Friday shift. Fridays are universally the busiest day for fish and chip shops and I was also training my replacement that shift. The line was out the building and customers were getting a bit uncomfortable with him forcing them in front of him in the line while the trainee was taking a long time working on an order. I was just like fuck this and called, 'let me take your order, I won't bite' trying to be friendly more so I could get my flow of customers going again than anything. He replies in a busy chippy with about 30 people (including kids) 'I don't want to be served by a faggot'. I snapped.

I was so over this damn guy, like what do you think I'm going to do? Curse your fish with the gay agenda? So, knowing I was leaving soon anyway shouted back 'well, I get paid if you let me serve you or not sunshine, so doesn't mean shit to me that you're too much of a fuckwad to get your food faster'. I was like yep this is me getting fired, but I just looked around to see like half the people laughing and half the people clapping. My boss was pretty chill about it and the old guy stormed out of the place never to return again.

And I&amp;#39;m already past my limit of this guy and without thinking I say &amp;quot;Fuck off!&amp;quot; waaayyy louder than I should&amp;#39;ve. His girlfriend immediately laughs because she&amp;#39;s been giving me apologetic looks all night, like she knows he&amp;#39;s been annoying. The guy kinda pouts at me and I really thought he was going to have a fit and turn it into a big deal but he eventually just laughs and puts his hand up for a high five. I reluctantly high five him and pour his shots and tell him to not do that again or I won&amp;#39;t serve him anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he slips me a $50 as he&amp;#39;s leaving. It was an open bar where we get tipped out 15% from the host so we don&amp;#39;t really expect guests to tip us much, so I was kinda shocked.&lt;/p&gt;

The summer was the slow season for us. We still had plenty of good business parties coming in, but if you were in a smaller section then you were left with the randomness of walk-ins. Though there were fewer summer shifts available, I needed to pick up and managed to find a newer server who wanted the night off. Unfortunately, that meant I was stuck in a less than ideal section. It was nearing close and I had only 10 covers the whole night so I figured it might be best to call it a night. 

As I’m walking to the front of the dinning room in walks our owner with a guest in tow.

“Will, perfect! Do you have a table open?” 

As if she was oblivious to the fact that the dinning room was barely half full. I tell her I do and she tells me they will be dinning in my section. I was a little mad because I was ready to leave, but the owner always tips over the top and takes care of us so at the very least I’d make some good money on an otherwise slow night. I show them to their table and start service. I learn that her name is Gretchen and they’re childhood friends and haven’t seen each other in decades. She was recently divorced and had started a new career as, as best I could gather, a life coach. 

Since it was slow I got to chat with them a bit. She asked me what I was going to school for at that time, did I play sports, family questions, etc. These were all questions tables had asked me before so it wasn’t out of the ordinary, but I felt her tone was more inquisitive. At the time I though it was so she could, presumably, give me life coach advice. I remember joking with one of the cooks that she was about to give me a palm reading.
They finished off dinner, split a dessert, and ordered some espresso martinis to finish up. I’m in the service bar printing the check for the owner to sign when she walks in the room.

“Will, listen, I need a favor. Harold already left and Gretchen needs a ride to her hotel so I need you to take her back.” 

This still wasn’t all that out of the ordinary. Harold is/was the owner’s personal assistant who would frequently drive drunk guests home. However, if they were in my direction I would drive sometimes too. I ask the owner which hotel and it’s basically the Ritz in town. It’s a little bit out of my way, but this is the owner asking for a favor for her friend so I really can’t say no. I say yes and that I’ll go pull my car up to the entry. Before I leave the bar she stops me once more. 

“Wait, you’ll need this before you go” and holds out Gretchen’s room key. 

I look at her puzzled for a minute. She wasn’t drunk; not to the point of being unable to find her room on her own at least, so for the life of me I couldn’t understand why I needed her key. Still confused, I take the key, and at that moment it hits me. Gretchen was looking for a rebound and the owner picked me for the one. I look at the key and smirk before leaving the bar.

&lt;p&gt;This still wasn’t all that out of the ordinary. Harold is/was the owner’s personal assistant who would frequently drive drunk guests home. However, if they were in my direction I would drive sometimes too. I ask the owner which hotel and it’s basically the Ritz in town. It’s a little bit out of my way, but this is the owner asking for a favor for her friend so I really can’t say no. I say yes and that I’ll go pull my car up to the entry. Before I leave the bar she stops me once more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wait, you’ll need this before you go” and holds out Gretchen’s room key. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look at her puzzled for a minute. She wasn’t drunk; not to the point of being unable to find her room on her own at least, so for the life of me I couldn’t understand why I needed her key. Still confused, I take the key, and at that moment it hits me. Gretchen was looking for a rebound and the owner picked me for the one. I look at the key and smirk before leaving the bar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Will, don’t forget, the guest always comes first.”&lt;/p&gt;

So last week I was reading a thread on r/TalesFromYourServer about customers sitting at tables that are still dirty, thoroughly enjoying myself. I decided to put some of the phrases I saw to use during my shift behind the bar at the local brunch joint. 

Sunday morning an older couple sit at the end of my bar, saying they're waiting on more people and just would like some coffee while they wait. The hostess preps their parties table and off they go, leaving behind their creamer pots but taking their coffee mugs with them. 

Now at this point I feel it is important to mention that each bar seat is preset with the menu, flatware, and a coffee mug. The last 2 seats were now missing their mugs and flatware.

I get a few drink tickets in and as I am in the middle of making a mocha a family of 3 sit down...at the end of the bar...
So I send a smile their way and let them know that I will be right with them! 
As I'm walking their way, I exclaim ""Ah! You guys must like warm seats, let me just clean up in front of you real quickly."" Mom seems startled and starts to apologize? I laugh it off and tell them that a couple had just been drinking coffee and that was all. 

Now the best part? I left to go get mom her hot tea and by the time I got back all 3 had scooted down. I almost laughed out loud at their ridiculousness. They had only scooted down 1 spot? Like, I cleared up 2 spots worth of creamer pots and utensils, but they only moved one.

Me- I'm sorry to hear that, I personally believe that we should have labels on our syrups as well, if you want to express that, you can get corporate's number online and talk to them about that

(Another note, I did not think that, even someone who is colorblind should be able to identify, we have a few of them here, and if they cant, they can always ask us)

C - No, I want to complain to the manager

M - I'll go get him, we can meet you up front

I wait in the kitchen for him to be done talking to him, in which a 4 top came in (who tipped me $1 on a $40 bill, they were kids, whatever) and after 15 minutes of him talking to the manager, he comes into the kitchen, turns out he was trying for 5 minutes to get a free meal (which was $5.48) and another 10 minutes asking for a free slice of pie and talking about the ""good old days""

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;why not?&amp;quot;, he asked angrily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;first, this place is self service&amp;quot;, I explained. &amp;quot;you go in, order whatever you want and you can either take it with you right away or we&amp;#39;ll serve it if it&amp;#39;s something that takes a bit longer. second, if I said &amp;#39;hey, old man, give me some money&amp;#39; you&amp;#39;d go furious. so either you get up, go to the bar and order your beer &lt;em&gt;nicely&lt;/em&gt; or you don&amp;#39;t get any&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then he was quiet. I continued collecting glasses and plates and when I returned to the bar he actually was there and ordered his beer politely. he even said &amp;quot;please&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

The owner has 7 fine cigar shops with bars and lounges, 2 liquor stores that specialize in top shelf alcohol and very fine wine and now he has opened a posh, upscale steak and seafood restaurant with a bar that matches.

That being said, I have worked at/managed every one of his locations. Each place has their own version of busy.  With the steakhouse winning the ""busy"" award daily.

Now to actually tell you the reason I'm making this post.  

We all get busy no matter what type of establishment we work at or position we hold.
That being said.... please PLEASE let's all take the time to think about our health and well being.

Just this past weekend I had a server lose a toe nail because of bad shoes.  A bar tender spread a cold like the plague. And, a cook that partied/skipped sleeping so much he made careless mistakes so bad he had to go to the ER for burns.

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure this has been said in this sub but...  TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!

Get a pedicure, yes even you guys.  Being on your feet is what's making your money.

Get good shoes.  Here's the being on your feet part again. 

Get some sleep/rest whenever you can.

Don't fill your body with too many chemicals (drugs or alcohol) and lose your sense of self.

And yes, take care of your mental health!
Restaurants, bars, lounges etc can be stressful work.  

Us managers need you but, you won't be any good to anyone if you dont take care of yourself.


We all have to be a certain amount of crazy to work these types of jobs.  Let's don't make ourselves worse or drag our health down while working.

At the bar I work at, we have seasonal customers. Now that summer is over, certain regulars are back, including a wisecracking group of old men (you know the type) and they are a pleasure to have. Each week they will spend a few hours sitting in the same seats and just hang out. When I first started working here, they would give me a hard time. They were never mean, just ball busters. But I know them a little more now (it’s been almost a year) and they know me and we’re all good. 

In spite of this, one of the men never talked to me much. I’m gonna call him Bob. He is a little gruff and the times in the past that I would try to make polite conversation with him, he didn’t really take to it. That’s okay, no worries, some people just want to hang out and I get that. Queue the first day of the season where this group comes back. I’m asking all around how summers and vacations were. Bob wasn’t there yet and I overheard the rest of the group saying how !Bob’s wife had passed away very recently, since I had last seen them all. (I didn’t know his wife). Noting this, I tried to carefully choose my words when Bob came to up to order, so that the subject wouldn’t be likely to come up. 

They were hanging elsewhere before taking their usual places at the bar, and a little later in my shift, Bob arrived first to wait for the others. It just so happens that my dishwashing sinks are directly under the bar where his usual spot is, meaning that I am hunched over directly in his face if I have to wash dishes. We exchanged a few polite words but remembering how he was a little dismissive of this last season, I just tried to be attentive but to leave him be. I’m washing for a bit, he isn’t saying anything. 

He takes out his phone and lays it on the bar and plays around with it a bit. All of a sudden, he turns the phone around and slides it over to me and I see an older picture from the 70’s of him and his wife. Before I know it, we are standing there looking through all these lovely pictures of them together, he is telling me about her with tears in his eyes so that he is making me begin to tear up, but i think we both just pretended it wasn’t happening. He showed me pictures of his beautiful grandkids and told me all about his family. We had never talked much or gotten to know each other much at all prior to this.

For example, a rule at almost ALL ayce places is
that it is mandatory to eat the sushi rice or else you will get charged for it. However, people will insist that they absolutely cannot consume the rice because
they are on a keto diet. Okay respectable, congrats on your road to health. We offer a selection (although it is small) of no rice rolls and appetizers. “But I don’t
like those ones.” Well then I suggest you don’t do AYCE and order a la carte so you can modify
your food however you like. “But ordering a la carte would be expensive for all the items I want” I’m just like . . . PICK A STRUGGLE SIS. 

Today I was scolded by a customer for not knowing the nutritional facts of the beer we sell. She asked me
which beer had less calories, Asahi or Kirin ? I responded by saying I wasn’t too sure. She was not
happy with my answer and explained to me that she was trying to lose weight, so it was necessary to consume a deficit in calories. In my head I was just thinking, “Perhaps just stick with drinking water?”

I don’t know, I view eating out as a “treat yourself” type of thing. What is the point of dining out if you’re going to put so many restrictions on yourself ? Also, please don’t get upset with servers when we can’t accommodate to your order exactly. We are only doing our job and trying to do our best.

they are on a keto diet. Okay respectable, congrats on your road to health. We offer a selection (although it is small) of no rice rolls and appetizers. “But I don’t
like those ones.” Well then I suggest you don’t do AYCE and order a la carte so you can modify
your food however you like. “But ordering a la carte would be expensive for all the items I want” I’m just like . . . PICK A STRUGGLE SIS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was scolded by a customer for not knowing the nutritional facts of the beer we sell. She asked me
which beer had less calories, Asahi or Kirin ? I responded by saying I wasn’t too sure. She was not
happy with my answer and explained to me that she was trying to lose weight, so it was necessary to consume a deficit in calories. In my head I was just thinking, “Perhaps just stick with drinking water?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know, I view eating out as a “treat yourself” type of thing. What is the point of dining out if you’re going to put so many restrictions on yourself ? Also, please don’t get upset with servers when we can’t accommodate to your order exactly. We are only doing our job and trying to do our best.  You can’t just walk into a restaurant and build your own meal, that’s the purpose of cooking and eating at home lol.&lt;/p&gt;

By 10am est this morning I had 22 texts and 7 voicemails from that monster Cate. Each one more urgent and manic as the last. Fuck it. I turned my phone off and went to the Bills game. What a blast.

Sara's BF went to our place to observe the 105 person brunch with no staff. This is all secondhand through text, but apparently, Cate was trying to cook herself while screaming at someone in the back. The guests were so pissed that their christening was ruined that I guess a bunch walked out. It was such chaos that Sara's BF actually grabbed a bottle of Stoli from the bar and left. No one was behind the bar lol. From what I gather from our group texts, it was a nightmare like no other. Good. She's lucky  She got off easy.

Sara is contacting the Labor Board in regards to our owed CC tips. It's NY state so it will take forever but action is being persued . We're all getting together tonight to drink and talk things over. The kitchen staff will be there too. It'll be epic.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone tries to swap me because it really is easy money given everyone has to run food regardless so I only have to run what isn't being ran (I also prep the rice/beans, etc. if the kitchen manager is absent.)

So my significant other is a part-time manager/bartender there and she was standing inside the bar making a drink and overheard the entire exchange.

I have two plates on my tray and there are two people sitting at the bar so easy enough. I set the tray down and I proceed to verify with the gentleman if he indeed ordered the steak fajitas - he nods in agreement and I place them in front of him along with a clean plate and his rice/beans/tortillas. I then place the other nacho plate his wife had ordered in front of her.

Soooo this is normally how my night goes with every guest - I set their food down and then ask if everything looks good and if I can get them anything else. Well this man decides he is going to be a Karen tonight.

He had about five seconds in between me setting his rice and beans down along with his wife's plate to realize this ""isn't what he ordered!"" Before I could even ask if everything looks good he says, ""I ordered the filet fajitas, these aren't filet!""

Now he ordered the steak well done so it was sort of crumpled up and could be mistaken for the filet which isn't what I did because I said, ""you're right, that looks like our regular steak fajitas. I'm sorry about that - hey SO can you 911 an order of filet fajitas for this gentleman.""

I proceed to pick up the steak fajitas to take them in the back and before I do I need say, ""would you like to hold onto these until your filet fajitas are ready?""

I mean the only thing we were going to do is eat them ourselves so I figured why not ask him if he'd like to have both.

Boy was I wrong.

Literally, a minute later my manager is back in the kitchen asking me what I said to him.

Apparently, he started cussing out and yelling at my SO saying he can't believe he just received that kind of service, he should be fired, he made me feel so stupid and made it seem I was the one who made the mistake, I come in here every week and spend good money, I'll never coming back here again unless that person is fired, blah blah blah. 

My SO comes back and joins the conversation and was speechless because I had literally said three things to the man and was nothing but apologetic. Even my manager was dumbfounded.

Soooo seeing as my company will comp anything and everything they comp his entire meal minus the drinks. He still tips the original bartender $20 who took his order that swears on his life he ordered the steak fajitas. 

I mean am I the asshole? I definitely didn't get in trouble but everyone is now making it a running joke that I, the soft-spoken nice guy, is a total dick.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posting on mobile so I apologise for the formatting.

I'm having serious issues with this at work. 

So at my job if someone doesn't sign their credit card slip, you have to sign a contract saying that within 90 days, if they report fraud with their bank, I am responsible for paying the bill.

If someone pays with a card and takes the entire credit card slip with them, then right then and there I have to pay for the entire bill. Even when I have the authorized slip that stays with me and doesn't go back to the guest. 

The logic is that I'm responsible for making sure the guests properly sign their slips. Unfortunately, that's not realistic. 

Today I had a party split their bill half way and pay with cards. Now I bring the slip to them, point to them exactly where they need to sign and literally tell them ""I need you to sign right here please"". I was waiting for them to sign while I was there so I could collect my books but they weren't and I had to run food so I said my goodbyes and went to go run my food. Then as soon as I come out of the kitchen see they're gone quickly so after I drop the food off I run to the table look at the book and find they took their slips. 

I run outside and got it back from half the party but the other party left already. I ask them to call him, explain the policy and tell them I'm sorry I need that slip back I really can't afford to pay for this. So they call him but they're all pissed at me. I ask for his name and number, they leave pissed off. An hour later he shows up pissed that he had to bring it back. First off all, he should have brought it back when he was halfway down the block. Second of all, it was crumbled up and barely legible. Third of all, he was being a jerk about it. I explained our policy and how we really need to have the physical copy signed for our records. He starts getting mad at me trying to argue about how sometimes he goes to other places he doesn't have to sign at all. I don't have time to argue with this man. I just explain that this is our policy, thank you so much for bringing it so I don't have to pay for it. You're really helping me here. Anyway, he leaves pissed. Then he called the resturaunt from the car in the parking lot yelling at my manager about the bad service I apparently have and how unprofessional it is that he was expected to come back with the signed slip. 

Whatever, the way I see it is if you pay for something and I tell you that you need to sign the slip, then you need to sign the slip dude. 

Also, if he didn't bring it back I was fully prepared to put my two weeks in because this isn't the first time this has happened to me and I'm sick of losing money at work because of this ridiculous policy. When I try to bring attention to it they claim they're protected because it's in the fine print paperwork we sign were hired.

Anyway, here are some excerpts I found especially confirming for my experience as a server:

&amp;#x200B;

""...employee health will be adversely affected when the **psychological demands posed by work are high, decision latitude is low, and social support is minimal**"" (p. 394?)

""the variety of behaviors recalled by servers suggest entitled customers feel both economic and socioemotional rewards are their due"" (394)

""more than half of participants reported trying to regulate their own emotions in an effort to avoid showing customers how they actually felt"" (395)

* and they go on to explain that this generally takes the form of ""suppressing negative feelings""
* then they compare this practice to the ways police officers cope with intense emotional reactions ""by applying humor or laughing it off""

When management is asked to assist servers in dealing with entitled customers, ""Management's response seemed to reflect an ideological view of the customer being 'always right'"" (395)

Then they assess ""**employee burnout**,"" which is ""**a syndrome characterized by exhaustion, cynicism, and lack of confidence**"" (399)

""Waitstaff is highly stigmatized, suffering from what some have called a **'servitude perception' -- a stereotype that may encourage customers' dehumanization of service employees**"" (400)

""Ultimately, feeling unable to restore balance in an unequitable exchange relationship because of dependence (being reliant on tips), because of powerlessness (being required by management to concede to customer demands)... creates\[s\] a sense of being treated as an instrument for fulfilling patrons' wants"" (cite: one of the last pages, I forgot the number srry)

About 3 years ago I quit working at this small town diner. There was a lady (we'll call her Karen, well..because) and her grandkids would come in and EVERYTIME she came in she would cause trouble. ""He likes his grilled cheese cut in 4.. I'll take a cup of chicken dumpling soup with extra guts (we aren't allowed to do that).. can I get a side of ranch *bring ranch* can I also get barbecue"" sort of stuff. 

Which brings us to a few days ago. I recently started working at this place again and in walks Karen her two grandkids and her daughter. And instant dread comes over me. 

Same thing, even though the ""kids"" are older now. He orders a grilled cheese. When I bring it out he obnoxiously shouts ""ANOTHER GRILLED CHEESE!"" Karen says ""no finish that first"" *turns to me* ""he usually likes his grilled cheese cut into four so now he thinks he's getting less"". I'm thinking, really lady, he's like 12 now. Anyway, they eat their food, everything is fine. Then comes check out time.

Karen: ""I'd like a quart of chicken dumpling with extra guts to go. I also want a small homemade jam to go as well.""

Me: ""ok, no problem."" It was getting to the last of the soup and it was almost closing time so I didn't mind giving her those ""extra guts"". 

I give her, her bill with the final total (around $50.00) and she pulls out her phone. She has a Groupon deal  for $30.00 off of a meal for 4. Fine and dandy. I read over the deal and was about to punch it in, but decided I had better let the owner know what I was doing. 

I go back to the kitchen because the owner is also the cook, and I tell him..

Me: Just so you know I'm ringing in a $30.00 groupon voucher.

Owner: We haven't dealt with groupon in like 6 months.

I was confused, hmm.. I go back out and look at the voucher once again and realize she had hid the expiration date. It expired in April. (I'm not familiar with groupon or how it works in my defense).

Karen: Well, ya, but I paid $18.00 for it, so I can at least get that. 

Me: No, we don't deal with groupon anymore, you should call customer service and take it up with them.

Karen: ""fine, I will call them"". Which she does, but..hangs up right before it can connect to someone.

She starts going through the groupon website and trying to justify her $18.00. ""See, look here, it says ""*nothing that has to do with anything*"" She precedes to do this 3 times. 

I go back and tell the owner how relentless she is being, he says ""if she starts being rude, let me know, I'll kick her out"". 

She sits at the table for no lie 15 minutes just trying to find something, ANYTHING that will get her this discount. I suggest trying to call customer service again, which she does, and hangs up around the same time again. I say something this time, ""why don't you wait to hear the options"", Karen: ""no, I can find it on my phone"". 

After all this sitting and scrolling she throws me her card. I just state ""okay, I'm going to run your card for the full price"". She looks at me and in the most snooty voice says ""well, YEAH, I'm not going to NOT pay my bill!"" And she finally leaves.

After we close up the owner tells me that she tried that same thing a few months back with another waitress. Same exact thing. She knew it was expired, she knew it wouldn't work, but she came in hoping she'd get away with it. 

Obligatory sorry for formatting, spelling etc. I'm on mobile.

TL;DR: Karen came in trying to use an expired voucher from a company our restaurant no longer deals with and spent about 30 minutes trying to justify how we should give her at least half of the discount.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to make this as short as possible, but this story is sticking with me and need to vent a little.&lt;/p&gt;

I was in the middle of a long shift (match day shifts suck absolute ass) and I was serving a lovely old man his beer. After I pulled the pint and gave him the beer, he said ""thanks sweetheart"" and went off with his drink to settle down. 
My best friend (who also works with me) was serving someone infront of her when a guy next to the person she was serving said this. 

""Why does she look so angry?""

My best friend knew without even needing to ask that he was talking about me, but she asked anyway. 

""Why does who look so angry?"" 
""Her over there"" he points at me 
My best friend goes ""she's not angry that's just her face""  

I'm very aware that I have a bad case of resting bitch face, but when he pointed me out, I was pouring a pint, I'm not going to look super happy all the time while I'm concentrating on pulling the perfect pint. 

I happen to pass near my best friend and the guy  clicked at me several times to get my attention. 

I hate it when people do that, it's so rude but I went over anyway. 

""Hi are you waiting?"" 
""No I just wanted to know why you look so angry"" 

I'm just in shock at this point because as far as I'm aware I look the same as i always do. 

""I'm not angry?"" 
""But why do you look so angry?""

""It's probably just my face, sorry about that."" 

My best friend was right next to me for this entire situation just so she could be there if anything happened. Thank gods she was there honestly. 

This guy starts MANICALLY LAUGHING IN MY FACE and says to me 

""No one's face just looks like that, why are you so angry?"" 

My best friends mouth just drops open and she starts to tell him off

""It's just her face dude, stop being So rude""

He goes off on one saying that he's not being rude, that I'm the one being rude by being so angry and not providing a good customer experience. 

I wasn't even serving him and he started picking on me I was so annoyed. 

At this point i just snap and I say 

""Look, this is just my face, I was not angry until you started clicking in my face and insulting me. You can get out of my bar if you think that is an acceptable way to speak to bar staff""

He holds his hands up and mutters a sorry and I walk off. 

My best friend is still stood there basically gobsmacked and this guy asks her if he really needed to put up with the way I spoke to him
 
She just stares blankly at him and goes 
""You just spent the last 5 minutes insulting her and talking to her like crap and you're surprised she kicked off on you?"" 

He just walked off after that. 
I reported it to my supervisor though and she found him and got him removed for abusing staff. 
He was with his mother and when my supervisor told her what happened she started screaming at him. 


I really do love my job but sometimes I really hate it because of people like that

Why are people so shitty sometimes? 

I sometimes work as a server in a members only speakeasy that is attached to a larger, more popular restaurant. Last night the main restaurant had a prearranged engagement party for 25ish guests. They had their own section marked off and their own server for the whole night. Needless to say they stayed and drank for about four hours. At around 10pm, when their party was scheduled to be over in the main restaurant, they asked if they could move to the speakeasy. Not wanting to upset them as they'd spent a shit ton of money the manager said okay. 

The speakeasy is a really cool little spot, but it's tiny. There's usually two bartenders and one server and that's it. And last night we were working with a new bartender who's still training. It's all craft cocktails too so waiting times for drinks can sometimes be around 10mins. When the group of 25 got into the speakeasy we explained to them that drinks would take some time and told them which drinks to order if they wanted speeder service. They said okay and we let them in, no problem. I start taking drink orders and putting them in. Mind you, we also have other guests in the bar waiting on their drinks. At first everything is okay, and they're just chilling. But queue to ten minutes later, about the wait time we had ALREADY warned them about, they started complaining about how ridiculous it was and where were their drinks. 

The head bartender is doing his best and banging out the tickets as fast as he could, but like i said this shit takes time. Slowly but surely I start running the drinks, but by this time they had all moved seats and I couldn't remember who exactly had what. There were also duplicate drinks on tickets so as I called out to see who had an old fashion random people would say ""oh, that's mine."" So I was getting confused bc some of the tickets were partially delivered and others were missing their drinks. Oy vey. 

Then this girl who had ordered some vodka sodas (of course) came up to me, as I'm trying to run drinks and get orders out, and very rudely asked where her shit was. Clearly she was someone who had never worked in a restaurant before. I tried to explain to her that we go in order of the tickets that came in, not based on how easy the drinks were to make. She tells me that making the drinks shouldn't take that long. Okay????? I say sorry and we'll get her here drinks as soon as they're out. Like there's literally nothing I can do about it lol. They're coming, and we're doing the best we can. 

THEN this older woman who had four drinks on her tab, all craft cocktails, comes up to me with the same bullshit wanting to cancel her order. I can see the bartender working on her ticket so I tell her it should only be a minute or two longer. She huffs and walks away. BUT THEN her son, who had to be at least 25-33 years old, comes up to the well and snatches a drink that was sitting there and says ""I've waited long enough I'm taking this."" It wasn't even on his ticket!! 

WHO. DOES. THAT. 

I've never seen a grown ass man act so entitled. 

The head bartender cuts him off after that, and rightfully so. But at this point we just want them out of there. So we let it slide and he keeps his drink. I start pre-bussing the shit out of the tables hoping they get the fuck up. I had also been working since 12pm that morning, straight through, and it was now around 12am so I was just over it. Eventually everyone got their drinks and I checked them all out no problem. But goddamn. 

I will say there was one really nice guy who was a part of the group. He was their saving grace.  I told him about the wait time and he said ""No problem, I can see you're busy."" When I dropped off his drinks he thanked me graciously. He was young too, like early 20s. Sometimes you just need one sane person like him to bring you back from the ledge lol. I hope he knows how much I appreciated his politeness and understanding. 

I just don't understand how people can act like that. I was so exhausted and just trying to accommodate them. It's not like I didn't want them to have their drinks lol. 

Anyway, thanks for listening Reddit. I feel mildly better lmfao.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry this is long but I needed to vent lol. Why are people so shitty sometimes? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then this girl who had ordered some vodka sodas (of course) came up to me, as I&amp;#39;m trying to run drinks and get orders out, and very rudely asked where her shit was. Clearly she was someone who had never worked in a restaurant before. I tried to explain to her that we go in order of the tickets that came in, not based on how easy the drinks were to make. She tells me that making the drinks shouldn&amp;#39;t take that long. Okay????? I say sorry and we&amp;#39;ll get her here drinks as soon as they&amp;#39;re out. Like there&amp;#39;s literally nothing I can do about it lol. They&amp;#39;re coming, and we&amp;#39;re doing the best we can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THEN this older woman who had four drinks on her tab, all craft cocktails, comes up to me with the same bullshit wanting to cancel her order. I can see the bartender working on her ticket so I tell her it should only be a minute or two longer. She huffs and walks away. BUT THEN her son, who had to be at least 25-33 years old, comes up to the well and snatches a drink that was sitting there and says &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve waited long enough I&amp;#39;m taking this.&amp;quot; It wasn&amp;#39;t even on his ticket!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHO. DOES. THAT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never seen a grown ass man act so entitled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head bartender cuts him off after that, and rightfully so. But at this point we just want them out of there. So we let it slide and he keeps his drink. I start pre-bussing the shit out of the tables hoping they get the fuck up. I had also been working since 12pm that morning, straight through, and it was now around 12am so I was just over it. Eventually everyone got their drinks and I checked them all out no problem. But goddamn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say there was one really nice guy who was a part of the group. He was their saving grace.  I told him about the wait time and he said &amp;quot;No problem, I can see you&amp;#39;re busy.&amp;quot; When I dropped off his drinks he thanked me graciously. He was young too, like early 20s. Sometimes you just need one sane person like him to bring you back from the ledge lol. I hope he knows how much I appreciated his politeness and understanding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t understand how people can act like that. I was so exhausted and just trying to accommodate them. It&amp;#39;s not like I didn&amp;#39;t want them to have their drinks lol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thanks for listening Reddit. I feel mildly better lmfao.&lt;/p&gt;

This will be long, I apologise. 

First things first, this is my first restaurant job. I've only ever worked retail and healthcare (still work in healthcare, this is just my second PT job which will be relevant in a second). 

Context: I am mainly a closing host and am by myself quite early in the evening, which is super stressful, especially on weekend dinner rushes. I get help from experienced coworkers and the managers but they have different roles to fill too. Yesterday, I had a really bad day at my FT job, and I am also worried about paying rent and bills this month. This just added more and more stress on me. I unfortunately did not leave these emotions at the door when I got to my closing host job, so I was bound to explode any moment. 

The situation from yesterday: At the restaurant I work for, servers are absolutely not allowed to come up to hosts and ask if they can get phased early or ask us to not seat them so we can close their sections. They're not even really supposed to be up here talking with us in the first place. I have had this drilled in my head by both lead hosts and managers. One server came up to my stand in the middle of a rush and asked if I could ask our manager if she could be phased early. I was in the middle of a huge mess of 15 people in the lobby and a party of 30 waiting outside. I was trying to restock utensils and keeping track of any new walk-ins when she did this. 

I was just shocked she did this, as she has been here for a year and should know not to ask us this (unless there is a secret host-server code here I'm not aware about). I had had it at this point and just said: ""go ask the manager"" and walked away. That doesn't sound too rude, but I did have an attitude when saying it and was very visibly mad. She did not approach me until about a while later, where she came back to the host stand and started talking about how I was disrespectful and to never get into her face again (I absolutely did not, this is the one thing I will deny about). And to top it all off, this happened in front of guests still waiting in the lobby. At this point, I did not want to deal with her talking anymore and interrupted her three times saying ""I apologize"" until she walked away. A little bit later, she got phased and I gave her her phase card without saying anything. I refused to stir the shit pot further. 

Talked with the manager after closing time, and he said I wasn't in trouble and he was on my side as she wasn't supposed to ask me this in the first place. As I calmed down, I did feel very bad about blowing up about something that is relatively small, but I still feel vindictive about her confronting me as a way to (possibly?)
embarrass and manipulate me in front of guests. I have not worked with her again since, but I am not sure how the atmosphere will be when we do. I don't like burning bridges, especially since I'm so new and do not want to create a hostile work environment. But, I do feel like the servers take advantage of my newness and might think I am kind enough to boss around, so I'm at a loss. 

I guess my questions are: how do I get over this, how can I prevent this from happening again (besides controlling my anger/frustration of course), and should I smooth things over? Would just an apology do, or would that seem condescending? Like I said, I've never worked in a restaurant before and I really don't know what to do. 

Sorry this is so long, but thank you for taking the time to read this.

EDIT: Thank you lovely people (who I assume are most likely servers) for giving me wonderful advice and support. This felt like a validation post, but I was so fearful that I did a big no-no in the host-server world. I would like to keep this job and save face, but I also need to stand up for myself despite being the new girl. This gave me the confidence to do so!!

Let me start by saying, servers are freaking awesome. I could never, ever do what you do; I hate people and know I'd lose my shit and my job in day 1. So thank you for putting up with the crap that you do.

I'm posting because, as the title implies, I have a question about tips. My family and I went out to lunch today (me, husband and 3 kids - 15y, 13y &amp; 7y).  My 7 year old and 13 year old both ate off the kids menu. Our waitress was not great, but not terrible ... just pretty indifferent and inattentive.  We were at a local diner and things weren't all that busy since it was 1:30 p.m.

I tipped $15 on our $60 bill.  I was going to tip less, but I thought twice about it and figured a few extra dollars wouldn't make or break me. Maybe she was having a bad day. Maybe she was annoyed that she was serving a table of 5 with 2 people ordering off the kids menu. Maybe it was obnoxious that 3 of us had water instead of ordering drinks. Whatever the reason, I figured a good tip would be a happy surprise for her. 

My husband asked me later why I tipped that much. He brought up the fact that I pretty much rewarded her for subpar service. It got me to thinking, does a good tip (when you know you haven't done a great job) encourage you and help you have a better day? Or just reinforce that you don't really have to put in much effort? Or maybe it doesn't register at all and I'm wasting my time thinking about it ... ? Whatever the answer, I'm still going to tip well; I'm honestly just curious.

Maybe she was annoyed that she was serving a table of 5 with 2 people ordering off the kids menu. Maybe it was obnoxious that 3 of us had water instead of ordering drinks. Whatever the reason, I figured a good tip would be a happy surprise for her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband asked me later why I tipped that much. He brought up the fact that I pretty much rewarded her for subpar service. It got me to thinking, does a good tip (when you know you haven&amp;#39;t done a great job) encourage you and help you have a better day? Or just reinforce that you don&amp;#39;t really have to put in much effort? Or maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t register at all and I&amp;#39;m wasting my time thinking about it ... ? Whatever the answer, I&amp;#39;m still going to tip well; I&amp;#39;m honestly just curious. Thanks to anyone who reads all the way through!&lt;/p&gt;

the cafe i work in prides itself on making as much as possible in house. i’m talking pastries, hummus, jam, peanut butter, and juice. what’s important to know is that the juice is made in our small catering kitchen a block from the cafe, so while it’s not made literally in the cafe, it’s made by the same “family” and delivered daily. 

now, this may come as a shock to my american friends, but france has a very “fuck you” attitude to customer service. you won’t find your jolly waitresses and small talk, and the customer is definitely not always right. 

so these two people are sat, and the woman comes to the counter to order for them. after ordering a juice for herself, she turns to ask if he wants one too, and he does so she orders one. our juice is a mix, but given that he never talked to me about it and wasn’t at the counter where the sign is posted, it’s understandable that he didn’t know this. 

immediately after their drinks are delivered, i am flagged down, addressed as “excuse me, australia” (where i’m from. we’d had a chat when they ordered their first round of coffees outside)  

i go over to see the problem. apparently, out juice tastes like tropicana. and, as he was just telling his friend, he is “an orange juice conneisseur”. i explain to him that the juice is actually a mix, and the added sweetness from the apple is likely what’s changing the taste for him. he insists that he juice is made from a concentrate, and is certainly not freshly squeezed. i tell him that while the juice is not made to order, it is definitely made with fresh products, in house. he refuses to budge  

after explaining the situation to my manager, i am sent back over to tell him that we will not be comping his juice just because he didn’t like it. he is not happy. he tells me that this is unacceptable behaviour and customer policy. i have to power here, but i try to explain it to him. as my manager said, he wants his juice comped because he thinks it’s made with concentrates, which isn’t true, so she’s not going to comp it. 

he proceeds to tell me, and then my manager when she comes to help me, that he is “always at [sister cafe, stocked by the same kitchen as us]” and that their orange juice there is “always fresh and doesn’t taste anything like that” (they literally don’t sell orange juice, just the mix). he asks me to call “that nice boss man who i always talk to” into the cafe on his day off, so that he can argue about juice. my manager suggests emailing him instead, and he tells us that he will, as he is a “close personal friend” of my boss. whose name he didn’t start using until my manager mentioned it 

basically, to end, would most policies be to comp a drink just because the customer didn’t like it? we always swap out anything relating to allergies or if we mess up an order, but i do feel that a comp just because you don’t like something is asking a lot of the cafe. i have worked in cafes where the manager would do it, but also some that wouldn’t, so idk what direction most go in

There were a brother a sister who were the FOH/bar/didn’t do anything but looked like they did, and the husband of the sister who was head chef. 

This was a few years ago and minimum wage laws have changed now, but at the time I was 16, and they could basically get away with paying people under 18 basically nothing.   They were paying me a basic rate of £4/hr, and had a policy that we had to hand in all our tips. I assumed this meant we all shared tips, which some places do, and as the UK doesn’t have as much of a tipping culture that places such as the US do, this isn’t as frowned upon as much.  Nope. The tips were taken off of us and split between the owners. Instead, we got a “bonus” on our wage. I was paid a massive £1/hr extra bringing my wage up to a whopping £5/hr. 

There were cases when we’d earn over £300 in tips a night, with 3 wait staff in a 6 hour shift...which I’d get an ‘extra’ £6 for that shift instead of £100.  Then the restaurant would close for a couple of weeks every couple of months for the owners to go on a big holiday - wonder how they afforded that. 

I had a specific situation where the couple thanked me profusely for looking after them so well, especially with us being busy and me being the only waitress working, and handed me a tip saying specifically ‘this is for you’. One of the owners witnesses this exchange and intercepted the couple as they were leaving, being all “charming” (well, smarmy), asking them why they had tipped me and not put the tip in the box placed on the bar. They told him what they’d told me, and that they wanted me to have it as I had earned it. As soon as they left, I looked awkwardly at the owner and asked what to do with the tip, and he just said ‘you know the rules’. So I put it in the box on the bar, giving them what was equivalent of an extra 2 hours wage for me. 

The restaurant in question is now shut down (I left long before that), I suspect a family friend reported them to HM Revenue and Customs for not paying tax on the extra income from the tips they stole.

So, I’m from a country where spanish is the main language and I feel like my english is pretty good.

I’ve been a waitress for 3 years and normally, I know what to do, but my new job requires me to speak english all the time. I can do it but I feel like there are a lot of terms in the service industry that I don't know about. 

I was wondering if you could help me with a speech that I can use so I get used to it. Thanks!

My supervisor told me not to sweat it, and she had no idea why Rat would make something this stupid up, when she could've just asked me to take her shift. 

I also had a coworker of mine tell me that Rat posted a picture of herself crying. The caption of her photo said something along the lines of ""I hate my cunty coworkers"". My feelings aren't hurt and I definitely don't feel bad. As for the fact that she ""hates"" me, I already knew that information, she lets me know in very aggressive notes. 

All in all, I'm happy with the outcome. I know she doesn't like me, but I'm there to make money, not friends. I will still be paid regardless of how she feels. Sure, it may be even harder to work with her from now on, but as long as I brought this was brought to the attention of my supervisor, I'm fine.

**ORIGINAL:**

I have posted about my shitty, shitty manager at the restaurant I work at. But for those of you who haven't seen my posts, I have an awful manager at my part-time restaurant job. She is unreliable, shady, and honestly pretty crazy ( I don't use that term lightly).

Anyways, I worked a few shifts this week, and have the entire weekend off. I have been looking forward to this for many reasons. 1. I have work **FOUR** 16 hour days, straight. 2. My puppy is sick and I finally have the time to monitor him without any distractions.

Well, about 5 minutes ago (3:40 PM) I get a text from my manager. She tells me she made a mistake in one of the schedules. (we have a paper schedule and an app that shows the schedule and it will remind you of an upcoming shift). She tells me she did not put me in the app for tonight, but put me on the paper schedule. I was always taught that we **must** follow the app's schedule because it is most accurate. Anyways, she then tells me that she ""accidentally"" scheduled herself tonight, and was offering her shift to me and tried to say it was technically mine. I would have absolutely no problem taking this shift, but I have an appointment right after the job I'm at now, I do not have time to find someone to care for my puppy, nor do I have the time to drive across town and back to grab my work clothes. These aren't the only issues with this problem, she also texted me less than an hour away from the shift.

I told her the reasons why I couldn't take the shift tonight, which led her to freaking out on me. I'm usually wanting to cover someone's shift, as long as I have a 3+ hour notice, and I'm not busy. But in this case, I am and she only gave me a 1.5 hour notice. She tried to make me feel guilty about the shift, and talked to me in a tone like it was my responsibility to take care of the shift, when in fact, it is not my problem.

Ultimately she texted me saying, ""Alright I'll cover YOUR shift."" Which I thought was extremely inappropriate, and I snapped back. I told her, ""Sorry, but if you had been looking at the schedule all week and had known about this, and told me about the mistake sooner, I'd be there! Have a good afternoon (:""

I'm now waiting for a text from my supervisor any minute, because I could only imagine what Rat said to my supervisor.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - My manager tried to lie about ""a mistake"" in my schedule. I declined to take the shift and she got upset with me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's a typical Monday evening, steady volume with a smattering of Take-Out orders flowing through. H takes an order but forgets a no meat mod, happens from time to time. Rings up the order for a total of $62 with the incorrect item costing $18. As soon as DB arrives we're boxing up the food (pastas, pizzas, some apps) and immediately notice the no meat pizza has meat! Oops, well the oven literally cooks a refire in 2 minutes so the ticket jumps the line and we're max 3 minutes out. The conversation between all parties continues as follows:

*H approaches M*

* H - umm, DB said he wants a full refund... Can you talk to him?
* M - like... For the $18 pizza or the full $62 order?
* H - the full order.....

*M approaches DB, who is still wearing his black mirrored sunglasses... inside... At 8pm*

* M - good evening sir, sorry about the mix up! We've got a refire working now and you'll be out the door in about 2 minutes.
* DB - sounds good, thanks.

*M starts to walk away, easy enough..*

* DB - hey excuse me, what about the refund?
* M - oh my mistake sir, what kind of refund were you anticipating?
* DB - well seeing as you totally fucked up my order, I'd like my whole order refunded.
* M - hmm alright, let me see what I can do

*M goes to bar drawer and pulls $9 cash out (50% of messed up item) and returns to DB with the corrected item in hand, 90 seconds*

* M - alright sir, here's your correct item. Again I'm really sorry for the slight inconvenience, so in order to reconcile the issue I'm inclined to provide you a 50% cash refund for the item
* DB - I said I wanted a full refund for the order.
* M - And unfortunately this is all I'm able to provide at this time.
* DB - IT WASN'T A QUESTION.
* M - I understand, however I'm afraid this wasn't a discussion.
* W - *grabs DB arm* alright it's fine we're already running behind let's just go

*DB and W leave... For 60 seconds*
*DB returns to the host stand*

* DB - *fuming*  I'll just give you back all the food and you can give me my money back.
* M - sir, if that's the direction you'd like to proceed I'm happy to provide a full refund in return for the product. Like I said, in order to reconcile this mistake I'm inclined to offer a 50% discount on the item.
* DB - I'M INCLINED TO SETTLE THIS A DIFFERENT WAY! We're running late because of you!
* M - Sir, the mistopped item took an additional 3 minutes to make. We typically assume 5-10 minutes buffer on all take out orders during peak volume so we actually are running ahead of schedule for this order. If you would like to return the food for a refund, I would be disappointed but happily give you cash back. Otherwise, please feel free to call or email me *hands card* if you would like to discuss this further.
* DB - *menacing smile* I really hope to see you again around here.
* M - likewise! I'm here most days throughout the week, I hope you have a great weekend.

*W pulls DB out the door, they sit in their car yelling for another 5 minutes then finally leave*

Whether or not they were running late to begin with is questionable, but given their persistence on confrontation I'm sure they definitely arrived late afterwards. I wonder what they spent the extra $9 on?

Otherwise, please feel free to call or email me &lt;em&gt;hands card&lt;/em&gt; if you would like to discuss this further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DB - &lt;em&gt;menacing smile&lt;/em&gt; I really hope to see you again around here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M - likewise! I&amp;#39;m here most days throughout the week, I hope you have a great weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;W pulls DB out the door, they sit in their car yelling for another 5 minutes then finally leave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not they were running late to begin with is questionable, but given their persistence on confrontation I&amp;#39;m sure they definitely arrived late afterwards. I wonder what they spent the extra $9 on?&lt;/p&gt;

Last weekend we were supposed to get together and catch up. Unfortunately 2 of her employees called out last minute so she called me for a rain check. Once she explained what was going on and that she needed to work I figured 'what the hay, I can help out if you need. I already have the day clear anyway'.

She took me up on it, so off I went.

Pretty basic stuff, I took orders and assisted with prep, that kind of thing. I picked up on how to plug in orders from Grubhub,Doordash,ubereats etc that would come in through various devices. The flow of customers was steady, not overwhelming. A gentleman came in and he was special needs. Very polite but insistent on tiny details. I was able to make sure everything he asked was taken care of  (including the specific amount of croutons he wanted for his salad) and that was that.

A group of teenagers wander in, all ordering kids meals (gotta love it), a couple of families and of course juggling the delivery orders helped the time pass by.

Then she walked in.

I looked up from the display I was arranging (fresh cookies YAY) and asked if I could help her?

""Pickup for Thomas""

hmmmm. I had entered all of the delivery orders received. None for Thomas. So I started double checking everything. I was there to help out and it would really suck if I dropped the ball on something so simple. 

Negative, no Thomas.

I asked if she was sure that she was at the right location? The franchise has another place about 5 miles away. She shrugged and left.

Not even a minute later my special needs customer emerges from the restroom and, as he passed by me, says ""where's my ride? She should be here by now"".

He looked at me and asks if someone has been here for him? Looking for Thomas?

At the beginning of this summer, our two manager team both decided to quit, which in turned lead our corporate office (down the street from our restaurant) to appoint their assistant to become our new manager. Now granted, he’s had many years building up a bbq restaurant, or so he alleges. Sorry lots of random information setting up this story. Also, don’t ask how someone went from managing a restaurant for years to becoming our corporate office assistant. Anyways, after he started working at our restaurant for two weeks, I opened one day working with him. While setting up for the lunch shift, What I noticed was that every time he passed by, my nose would immediately pick up his trailing scent of body odor. I would instantly gag. To ensure I wasn’t the only one, I went up to another server and asked her if she smelled BO, she replied with, “how can you not?” 

Me: does he always smell like this
Her: yah, you haven’t noticed until now?
Me: this is my first time working with him 
Her: it’s been like this since he started. Can you please do something about this

I thought to myself what an awkward conversation to have with your manager. Obviously I didn’t want to have this conversation so I went to the closing server and asked if he noticed the BO.

Him: yah it’s so bad
Me: well, as the closing server you should talk to him about it
Him: oh hell no. You do it.
Me: but you’re the closer. 
Him: I can’t do that ahaha 

I thought of other options. I went to the bartender. 

Me: have you noticed the BO
Her: omg where have you been this whole time. You haven’t noticed?
Me: it’s my first time working in close proximity to him. 
Her: yah it’s so bad. This is a restaurant, he can’t be going around smelling like that. We work with food.
Me; lying: yah, I know. Well, the other servers and I kinda talked and we voted that you should go and talk to him about it. 
Her: what?
Me: yah we all voted
Her: I’m not doing that. If anything he rarely comes into the bar so I don’t really have to deal with it as much as you guys.
Me: hmmm

Just when all seemed lost, I realized I could talk to the kitchen manager. I sped over to the sushi cutting station and asked him to talk to the manager about his BO. He shook his head and said he couldn’t. After exhausting all options, I decided that I had to be the one to talk to him about his body odor. I walked to the office. I had to tell him this now or never, but mainly now because we had 10 mins until restaurant opening for lunch.

Me: hi, can I talk to you

Manager: sure, sure

Me: ummm okay so we’ve all been talking and we all noticed that there seems to be BO around here. And we all kinda think it’s coming from you

Manager: BO??? 

Me: yah

Manager: what’s BO???

Me: oh, umm well then... ummm it stands for body odor

Manager: ohhh ok. Is that ummm good or bad?

Me: bad, oh definitely bad

Manager: oh that’s weird. No one has ever told me that. My wife has never said anything. 

Me: well, maybe because it’s in the middle of summer and it’s starting to kinda get hot, and I don’t really know if it’s a deodorant issue- 

Manager: oh maybe. I don’t wear deodorant.

Me: oh.... well maybe we need to start??

Manager: ok. I have it in the car I guess I can go and put some on later.

Me: yes, oh god yes pls

*30 mins later*
While at the expo line inputting an order, my manager comes behind me and spreads his arms out and asks, “is this better?”

Keeping my eyes on the point of sales computer, I took a whiff and immediately regretted. The stench singed my nose. Surely whatever microscopic bacteria that lived in my nose must’ve burned away. 

Me: umm no

Manager: oh really? Huh. 

Me: I mean... I guess it doesn’t really work retroactively??? I normally put it on after I shower. I guess you have to put it on really before your body produces that odor. 

Manager: are you sure??? Are you sure that’s how it works??

A small tear began to form from the corner of my eye. In that moment, I knew I was going to suffer the entire lunch shift. I replied, “yes. Yes I’m sure that’s how it works.”

Tonight a coworker asked if I could take a table in his section because he had it sat immediately after getting a 15 top. No problem, I take it.
 It's a single guy and a small child in a high chair though I notice he has 2 menus. I ask if anyone is joining him and he says yes, and she is here. I ask if he wants to start with anything and he says no.

 About 10 minutes later a woman obviously on some kind of drugs (zoned out, jaw clencing etc) sits down with a margarita. I figure she must have went up to the bar to get it so I just ask if they wanna order food. Literally all she says is, ""Water.""
 Rude. But I get the water and ask again if they'd like food. She asks if she can get an order of half Fried Pickles and half Mozzarella sticks and I tell her we can't do that but we have a deal for gameday where they're $5 anyway so does she want both? ""I guess.""
 I ring those in and my manager comes up and I ask if she already paid for the margarita at the bar, assuming that's the reason he's coming to me. 
 He says no and that I need to ring it in. I go talk to the bartender about her as well and he says she was kind of a b* when he asked for her ID. She had said it was in the car and was he really going to make her go get it? Of course! 

My manager approaches me again and says, ""A man up at the bar overheard her talking about walking out on her bill so keep an eye on her.""

 Anyway, about ***thirty minutes*** go by and she says that she doesn't like her half drunken margarita. I look at the ***blended*** margarita and ask what's wrong with it. She says it's watered down. I inform her that blended margaritas are made with ice blended up in it so... yeah essentially watered down by ice aftee all this time you moron. I ask if she'd like us to remake it 'on the rocks' and she agrees.

Meanwhile, I'm watching them like a hawk and smiling at them every time I walk by to make sure they don't walk out. 
 I eventually bring their bill and they pay the whole $18. No tip. They get up and walk to the front and I notice them lingering up at the cashier stand, talking to the cashier. My coworker comes up to me and says, ""You're table just asked to speak to a Manager."" Oh boy, here we go. Typical complain about the margarita/food/anything to get something for free. So I'm waiting around for them to leave so I can ask him what it's about.

They leave and I go in to the office and ask, ""What did they say?""
He deadass looks me in the eyes and says, ""She wanted to know if we were hiring.""
We. Fucking. Lost. It.
The audacity! Lmao. My manager went through how to apply with her and everything and she had the nerve to ask if she could be hired straight to serving, and asked how if we get to keep all our tips and what our tipout policy was. After leaving ***NO TIP***!

We were in hysterics. Like out of all the things I expected her to be up there talking to him about, that was the last. He ended up specifically asking for her name so he could make the note: Do Not Hire ___ ""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work at a chain restaurant of the wings + sports variety. Tonight a coworker asked if I could take a table in his section because he had it sat immediately after getting a 15 top. No problem, I take it.
 It&amp;#39;s a single guy and a small child in a high chair though I notice he has 2 menus. I ask if anyone is joining him and he says yes, and she is here. I ask if he wants to start with anything and he says no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 10 minutes later a woman obviously on some kind of drugs (zoned out, jaw clencing etc) sits down with a margarita. I figure she must have went up to the bar to get it so I just ask if they wanna order food. Literally all she says is, &amp;quot;Water.&amp;quot;
 Rude. But I get the water and ask again if they&amp;#39;d like food. She asks if she can get an order of half Fried Pickles and half Mozzarella sticks and I tell her we can&amp;#39;t do that but we have a deal for gameday where they&amp;#39;re $5 anyway so does she want both? &amp;quot;I guess.&amp;quot;
 I ring those in and my manager comes up and I ask if she already paid for the margarita at the bar, assuming that&amp;#39;s the reason he&amp;#39;s coming to me. 
 He says no and that I need to ring it in. I go talk to the bartender about her as well and he says she was kind of a b* when he asked for her ID. She had said it was in the car and was he really going to make her go get it? Of course! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My manager approaches me again and says, &amp;quot;A man up at the bar overheard her talking about walking out on her bill so keep an eye on her.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;thirty minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; go by and she says that she doesn&amp;#39;t like her half drunken margarita. I look at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;blended&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; margarita and ask what&amp;#39;s wrong with it. She says it&amp;#39;s watered down. I inform her that blended margaritas are made with ice blended up in it so... yeah essentially watered down by ice aftee all this time you moron. I ask if she&amp;#39;d like us to remake it &amp;#39;on the rocks&amp;#39; and she agrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I&amp;#39;m watching them like a hawk and smiling at them every time I walk by to make sure they don&amp;#39;t walk out.

So be gentle.

I work at a fine dining restaurant in a tourist town. We are approaching the beloved “off season” when the locals come out to play, and the nights are a bit earlier. Tonight, a “kind of” local, let’s call her Jen, comes in 20 minutes before we close with 3, second home owners. Don’t worry, I love them. They pay my bills, and are generally pretty nice. 

Anyway. Jen comes in, states that we are “not to worry, I’m in the industry and we’ll be quick!” So I greet them, they ignore me, I force a drink order. I deliver said drinks, and attempt an appetizer order. They ignore me. I notice their filled out sushi menu, so I grab it and carry on. It’s fine, I had a rough night and didn’t want to talk much either. So I pace out their meal with little communication. No more than the obligatory “how are things?”, “can I take your plate?”, “would you like me to box up your food?” I’m still cool with the ignoring, I have other tables to reset. 

Then an hour goes by, we closed 45 minutes earlier. They’ve paid their bill and only water glasses remain on their table. All the other tables have left, the sushi chefs have left, the other servers have left. All with obvious goodbyes for the only people left to hear. We’ve turned the lights off in the back half of the restaurant. I have refilled their waters once, and grabbed their tab to do my check out. Another half hour sneaks by... I’ve changed my shoes, and put on my jacket. I’ve put all the necessary things to reset their table on the table next to them. My manager says I can leave but I’m not sticking her with the clean up. So to push things along, I holler at her that my dogs have been inside for 12 + hours and I have to jet to feed them... (my boyfriend fed them and let them out, they’re fine). Jen and her friends hear this, and are still camping. Then the kitchen guys come out, they’ve finished. They yell across the restaurant, “goodnight! We’re leaving” I yell back, “goodnight Dave the dishwasher!” Suddenly, Jen, who’s in the industry, and knows that the dishwasher is the last to finish, decides it’s time to leave. We’ve been closed for nearly 2 hours!

I’m not one to bitch much about late night campers, but if you’re claiming to be quick and you work in the restaurant industry, CATCH THE HINT.

Long line at concessions at the movies. People, obviously, are more irritated than normal because they had to wait *&lt;&lt;gasp&gt;&gt;* 10 minutes for popcorn!! How outrageous.

*Anyway....* this guy comes up and tells me what he wants to order before I even say ""hey what can I get you?"" and the proceeds to take out his phone and scan the barcode for I guess this coupon he had. Now, the thing is, if you do this the coupon won't do anything or register with the machine because it will just try to read the barcode as though it were a product, and obviously it wont match to anything so nothing will come up. If you have a coupon I have to go and actually pull up the coupon page. Usually it's not a big deal because I can ask the person to scan again.

Which is what I do. I get all his stuff, and get prepared to charge him, when I ask if he can scan his coupon again and he just gets PISSED.

He's like ""I *already* scanned it dude!"" 

*puts his hand on his forehead frustratedly, pulls out his phone to check.*

""It's not coming back up. (Aggressively audible sigh) GOD, I'm already late to my movie and I've been waiting forever... whatever, just scan my rewards."" 

Even though it's his fault and he's being rude, I decide to be nice anyway and go ""It's okay, I won't charge you the popcorn. Your total is...""

I guess that made him feel guilty because then he said ""Have a good night"" after i was done charging him.

I used to work at a small but reputable NorCal microbrewery. I did everything FOH including running the floor as supervisor while taking a full section. One Saturday afternoon, a young couple came in and sat at one of my tables. They were from a town a few hours away and were excited to get to try out some of the beers we only had available in house, but were disappointed when I couldn’t serve one of them due to his expired ID. He wheedled and whined, showed me his printed out temporary license from the DMV, and finally yelled at me about it being the state’s fault for being months behind issuing new licenses because of recent design changes. Didn’t matter to me; the law was the law and I was not allowed to serve him, so sorry. So his girlfriend had her beer, they both had some food, and I figured we were done. 

Then I came in for my shift on Sunday afternoon. 

As I pushed through the front doors, guess who I saw with a pitcher of beer between them and two glasses?

I tossed my purse down behind the bar and went to find their server. Mary was brand new to serving. She’d just been promoted from hosting and now here she was getting questioned by me about whether she’d carded that guy and had she checked the expiration date. Poor girl. I was gentle with her because I knew it was an honest mistake, but she was still mad at herself for screwing up and was tearing up over it. Now that I had the facts, I walked over to the table. 

Me: Hey buddy, how’s that beer today?

Guy, looking like a deer in the headlights because he definitely remembers me: Uhhhhh, it’s really good?

Me: So your ID came in the mail just last night, huh?

Deer Guy: Uhhhhh, yeah?

Me: And you drove two hours home to get it, then two hours back here just to try that beer? That is so cool! I’m so flattered! Can I see the ID though, because these new ones are really cool. I love the little bear on them!

Deer Guy: Uhhhhh...okayyyy? 

He gets out his wallet since he’s got no choice now, and of course he hands me the same expired ID as he had the day before. 

Me, pointing to Mary, who is still crying and trying to pull herself together: Look at that girl over there. Look at her! You did that to her! You came in here knowing it wasn’t legal for us to serve you, knowing the manager wouldn’t serve you yesterday, and you were still so selfish you’ve put that poor girl’s job in jeopardy because you weren’t responsible enough to get your license renewed in a timely manner. I hope you’re happy with yourself. You can both leave now. 

Deer Guy: But what about our food?

Me: Sorry, we don’t serve assholes who think their drinking is more important than our staying in business. Get out and don’t come back. 

I picked up their glasses and dumped the contents into the pitcher, made a show of hollering into the kitchen to cancel their order, and went and gave poor Mary a hug. 

That girl turned out to be one of my best servers, and I guarantee she never forgot to check an expiration date again.

ETA: There seems to be some debate about the topic of expired ID+temp ID being valid for alcohol sales. Look up the laws for your individual states, folks. I haven’t worked in every single one, but I *have* been lied to and told it was ok by plenty of managers who should have known better in places where it was definitely illegal. And I’ve worked in both the most conservative and most liberal states, and they are all consistent on the subject.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by another post, I’d like to share one of my most frustrating expired ID stories. &lt;/p&gt;

He wheedled and whined, showed me his printed out temporary license from the DMV, and finally yelled at me about it being the state’s fault for being months behind issuing new licenses because of recent design changes. Didn’t matter to me; the law was the law and I was not allowed to serve him, so sorry. So his girlfriend had her beer, they both had some food, and I figured we were done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I came in for my shift on Sunday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I pushed through the front doors, guess who I saw with a pitcher of beer between them and two glasses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tossed my purse down behind the bar and went to find their server. Mary was brand new to serving. She’d just been promoted from hosting and now here she was getting questioned by me about whether she’d carded that guy and had she checked the expiration date. Poor girl. I was gentle with her because I knew it was an honest mistake, but she was still mad at herself for screwing up and was tearing up over it. Now that I had the facts, I walked over to the table. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Hey buddy, how’s that beer today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy, looking like a deer in the headlights because he definitely remembers me: Uhhhhh, it’s really good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: So your ID came in the mail just last night, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deer Guy: Uhhhhh, yeah?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: And you drove two hours home to get it, then two hours back here just to try that beer? That is so cool! I’m so flattered! Can I see the ID though, because these new ones are really cool. I love the little bear on them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deer Guy: Uhhhhh...okayyyy? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gets out his wallet since he’s got no choice now, and of course he hands me the same expired ID as he had the day before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, pointing to Mary, who is still crying and trying to pull herself together: Look at that girl over there. Look at her! You did that to her! You came in here knowing it wasn’t legal for us to serve you, knowing the manager wouldn’t serve you yesterday, and you were still so selfish you’ve put that poor girl’s job in jeopardy because you weren’t responsible enough to get your license renewed in a timely manner. I hope you’re happy with yourself. You can both leave now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deer Guy: But what about our food?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Sorry, we don’t serve assholes who think their drinking is more important than our staying in business. Get out and don’t come back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up their glasses and dumped the contents into the pitcher, made a show of hollering into the kitchen to cancel their order, and went and gave poor Mary a hug. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That girl turned out to be one of my best servers, and I guarantee she never forgot to check an expiration date again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ETA: There seems to be some debate about the topic of expired ID+temp ID being valid for alcohol sales. Look up the laws for your individual states, folks. I haven’t worked in every single one, but I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been lied to and told it was ok by plenty of managers who should have known better in places where it was definitely illegal. And I’ve worked in both the most conservative and most liberal states, and they are all consistent on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

I work at a very small, local fine dining restaurant that’s been open for almost 25 years now. We are known for our steaks and seafood. People in our area rave about how delicious and reasonably priced food is. It’s a local gem and it’s rare when we have anyone complain. This all happened on my dinner shift this last Tuesday.

TLDR at the bottom!

First table I am sat is a middle aged couple. They’re not dressed horribly but definitely not the business casual get-up we prefer our customers to wear. The gentleman had a baseball cap on backwards, and I tried my best not to pass judgement when I saw them come inside the restaurant. It’s a slow Tuesday, we need the walk-in customers. Whatever.

I proceed to greet the table, introduce myself and get drink orders. Nothing fancy, dude just wants a coke and the lady sticks with water after what seemed like an internal struggle she had with herself to decide if she wanted a glass of wine. I then go over the off the menu features we were offering for the evening, and they both seemed pretty overwhelmed by the list. To be fair, we can range from 3 entrees to 9 entree features on any given night. Thats another rant in itself.

I asked if they had any questions about the features or the menu. Of course, the only questions they had were about the prices. “Yes sir, Seabass is running at $38 tonight” (queue his eye roll), “yes ma’am our soup today is Manhattan Clam Chowder, not New England. And no, we can’t make Lobster Bisque, I’m so sorry we do not have fresh Lobster in house atm”. The lady then tells me the last time she was here was 10 years ago and this is their anniversary and her husband has never dined here before. 

Finally they order an appetizer of Baked Brie. This is a local favorite! Put the order in, and then they order entrees. Great! Let’s get this ball rolling!

I present the Baked Brie to the table, refill drinks, and give it two ish minutes before checking on them again.

“And how are we enjoying the appetizer this evening?”

Lady “We aren’t fond of it. It’s not how I remember it to be. The sauce is too sweet (it’s a bechamel sauce) and the Brie is undercooked”. It looks like they ate half of it. The puff pastry that surrounds the Brie is a beautiful crisp golden brown and the Brie itself is melted in the center.

I offer to have it redone or another appetizer made but they refused. Ok. Great. Chef asks me to comp the app, I do as instructed and inform the table. Time to take out salads.

I drop salads at the table, add fresh cracked pepper to the lady’s salad. The man pics at the salad a bit and asks about the dressing. Our house dressing is a creamy Italian that we make ourselves. I check on the rest of my section then go back to see if they need any refills. Lady hasn’t touched her salad so I asked if everything is alright. “Well, I don’t remember the salad dressing being this sweet! Do you not have ranch? I remember y’all having ranch!”. So, I make another salad, we don’t keep ranch but I bring her another house made Dijon dressing. 

At this point I fire the food with the chef and we are both concerned that food will be sent back again. They ordered two Filets with Bearnaise sauce. When the food is ready, I take it to the table, refill drinks, and leave for a couple minutes hoping they don’t push back plates.

But wouldn’t ya know... “ma’am!” Lady pulls me aside to their table. “Is this the same bearnaise sauce y’all have always had?”. I reply “yes ma’am, we haven’t changed recipes in 24 years.” She kind of gives me a blank look and then “we’ll, the sauce is too sweet. And I’ve been waiting for you to check on us. Because of that my steak is cold. Just put it in the microwave and give me another sauce that isn’t sweet”.

“So sorry, yes ma’am!”

Of course I take the plate back to the chef. We both taste the sauce, and of course it’s PERFECT. And it’s not sweet, either. So we put a mushroom sauce with the reheated steak (from the grill). The lady seems happy with the fix.

Finally it’s time to ask about desserts. I clear plates, and offer an anniversary Tuxedo Cake that we provide complimentary for such occasions. She looks at her husband and says “Honey would you like a piece? I’ll have a bite! I remember the cake being great!”.... mind you I’m still at the table waiting for a yes or no for the cake.

He replies “you remember a lot of things being great about this place. I think we’ll pass on dessert.”

What. The. F. 

I clear the table, drop the check, thank them for dining and wish them a happy anniversary. They hurriedly sign their receipt and leave.

I shouldn’t be surprised. I am still salty about this a couple days later. They end up tipping $5 on their $77 bill. Of which WE COMPED AN APP. I’m so sorry that we are not what you remembered 10 years ago, lady. But we were nothing but kind and accommodating with every course YOU PUSHED BACK. And you have the audacity to tip me less than 10%?! 

I’ll be adding gratuity to their check if I ever see them again.

After eating for awhile Stanley goes up to him to ask if he needs anything else and he looks Stanley dead in the face and went “I have $30 for a hand job”. Stanley is a funny person and a great team player and he just laughed it off. After the guy left we had the restaurant to pretty much ourselves and we about died laughing. I can say one thing, it’s a day and a face we won’t forget and a $30 he won’t forget! (JUST KIDDING HE DIDNT ACTUALLY DO IT FOR THOSE WHO DIDNT GET THE JOKE AT THE END)&lt;/p&gt;

I wish to relate a tale and ask your experiences.

I've worked at my restaurant serving for 3 years, and am the second most senior front end employee. My manager, Roland, rocked up 2 years ago, and seems to have me on permanent probation. Not for any reason, mind you... clean record, etc. Namely, I'm not trusted to do my own voids. So, voiding involves dropping everything I'm doing, finding another server, getting them to drop everything *they're* doing, monopolizing a POS terminal while I regale the other server with ***t h e    t a l e    o f    t h e    v o i d***, and getting them to punch in their magic code. After that, I have to go to the back and fill in a chart detailing the date, check #, void type, reason, and dollar amount. This does not work during a rush.

As such, I wind up punching in other employee's codes to do my own voids. It's not Roland's way, but everyone tolerates that as opposed to me badgering them for approvals and getting underfoot. Most of them are similarly confused as to why this one function is being held over my head.

Roland wised up to this, and is something pissed. I tried to explain the prohibitive difficulty of following protocol on anything but a totally dead night. ""Of course I meant to write out ***t h e   t a l e   o f    t h e    v o i d*** in the back, Roland! But, you know, I ran three tables worth of drinks, you triple sat me, table 32 wanted to return a bowl of soup, 42 needed change and holy fuck I forgot all about it!"" I pleaded, tears dancing in my emerald eyes, the very image of a woman with nothing left to lose... or, y'know,  I suggested that if I could authorize my own voids, the print outs would be more transparent (I wouldn't be ringing them in under other employees). He said that I'd have to use his system for a while to establish trust before getting my own code, creating a vicious cycle. 

Has anyone experienced something similar? At my other jobs, voids are a fact of life and a server's duty, like roll ups or repeating specials five times over. If Roland can't trust me to void $8 in wine, why do I handle large amounts of cash on behalf of his company 5 nights a week? Sorry for the rant.

A few weeks back, we received an online order at 2:29PM, with a promise time of 2:45PM. That means the person who did their online order finished touching their phones at 2:29PM. Guy walks in at 2:35PM and gets mad because he sees the online ticket with his name on it and we didn't even get started on it (I was real close to starting on it).

&amp;#x200B;

So while he's waiting in line and I start his online order, my co-worker came to help out at that exact moment (I was alone because it was pretty slow at the time). So it still had 10 minutes left until promise time right? Why are we starting this order when there are 2 customers in line?

I explain to my co-worker with a firm and loud (but not too loud) voice so that everyone can hear that ""It's due in 10 minutes from now, but the customer is here now so let's just do it now"". So we start making it while the 2 customers are just standing there waiting (even though we try to avoid them waiting that's why online orders give us flexibility on when to start them).

I work at a boba tea shop. He was an older man with a beard, and the sleeves of his jacket were tattered. He walked around, with a look of wonder and soft smile on his face. After curiously looking around the shop, he came up to the register with his debit card in hand and said:

“I’m not sure if this card will work, but I’d like to buy something from here. What’s the cheapest thing you have?”

Immediately, I assumed he must have stolen the card. But honestly, if he tipped, it didn’t matter to me.

“You can try the snacks on the wall here.”

“Oh! Yes, maybe I’ll try those. But what are the main things you have here?”, his eyes scanning the menu.

“We serve teas and drinks.”

“What’s the \[specialty drink\]?”

“It’s a smoothie, but it’s one of the more expensive items.”

“I’ll try that.”

After ringing him up for the drink and his card goes through fine, he asks:

“And what are those, ah, colorful snack sticks everyone’s been grabbing? I’ll try one of those.”

I buffered for a moment, looking where he was gesturing to the customers grabbing straws after grabbing their drink.

“Oh…the straws? You can just grab one when you get your drink.”

He grabs a blue straw in the bin by the register, and after investigating it, turning it over in his hand for a bit,

“Very interesting! Thank you.” He goes towards where the drinks are picked up but forgets his straw at the register. I figured he’ll grab another by the pick-up spot, so I put the straw back in the bin.

When he gets his drink, it comes with a dome top that you can stick a straw through the top of. I watched as he removed the cap and seemed confused as to how he would drink it, poking at the whipped cream on top.

He comes back to the register and says,

“I grabbed a blue snack stick earlier and I think I left it somewhere, I’m not sure where…”

“Oh, I’ll grab it for you!”

Handing him the straw back, he asks,

“So, how are people eating this?”

“It’s--It’s a straw. It’s a way to drink your order. You just stick it in your drink.”

“It’s not flavored or anything? I can’t eat it?”

“No, it’s not edible.”

“So blue is not blueberry-flavored?”

“No, it’s not.”

“Oh, alright.”

He goes back to his drink, and I don’t see the process since a wave of customers came in, but I notice later he’s using the straw in his drink, dome cap removed.

After finishing his drink, he goes to the wall of snacks and picks out a box of Pocky.

“I’ll have these, ah, breadsticks.” He looks fondly at the box of Pocky he’s picked out and chuckles a bit.

“Alright, would you like a bag?”

“Wha-what did you say?”, he says, leaning in.

“Would you like a bag?”

“What’s that?”

“It’s-It’s just a way to hold your stuff.”

“Oh, no that’s alright!” he pays with card again and finishes up his drink and snack in the shop.

Before leaving, he starts a conversation with me about how this place reminds him of another place in the neighborhood, but they don’t have drinks or snacks, and he can’t remember what it was called but the feel was the same and ends with,

“You know, I don’t have a cellphone. Surprising, right?”

Which was probably the least surprising thing about him. I hope he comes again.

TL;DR: “Man” comes into tea shop, doesn’t recognize straws or bags, calls Pocky “breadsticks.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is pretty different from the absolute horror stories on here, but I couldn’t stop thinking about this customer that seemed to come from another planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I grabbed a blue snack stick earlier and I think I left it somewhere, I’m not sure where…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, I’ll grab it for you!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handing him the straw back, he asks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So, how are people eating this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s--It’s a straw. It’s a way to drink your order. You just stick it in your drink.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not flavored or anything? I can’t eat it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, it’s not edible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So blue is not blueberry-flavored?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, it’s not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, alright.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes back to his drink, and I don’t see the process since a wave of customers came in, but I notice later he’s using the straw in his drink, dome cap removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing his drink, he goes to the wall of snacks and picks out a box of Pocky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll have these, ah, breadsticks.” He looks fondly at the box of Pocky he’s picked out and chuckles a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alright, would you like a bag?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wha-what did you say?”, he says, leaning in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Would you like a bag?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s-It’s just a way to hold your stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, no that’s alright!” he pays with card again and finishes up his drink and snack in the shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before leaving, he starts a conversation with me about how this place reminds him of another place in the neighborhood, but they don’t have drinks or snacks, and he can’t remember what it was called but the feel was the same and ends with,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know, I don’t have a cellphone. Surprising, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which was probably the least surprising thing about him. I hope he comes again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: “Man” comes into tea shop, doesn’t recognize straws or bags, calls Pocky “breadsticks.”&lt;/p&gt;

We have a tiny restaurant, and this event keeps up packed to bursting all day and night. It’s incredibly physically and emotionally exhausting. 

One of the only benefits, outside of the bomb sales, is there’s always 10 people waiting behind the person you just pissed off, so I get to be a little bit more blunt than usual. I don’t need the table that wants to be pissy, fuck y’all, play by my rules or leave. 

Not that I don’t try to work w/ the pissy folks, I’m the manager so that’s kind of my job. Every single person is hot, tired, a lil drunk be hungry, so that’s going to bring out the temper in even the most docile people. However, my whole staff and I are also hot, tired, and hungry w/ bladders about to explode, so we can only be pushed so far. 

But it never fails, in all the normal hangry folks, there’s always one Karen. Karen walks in w/ her friend and is one of the lucky few to grab a seat at the bar top. Yay for her. She orders 2 glasses of red wine and one of my slammed bartenders rushes off to grab the order. 

Now at this point, I should let you know, my place is nowhere near fine dining, it’s not a trash hole or a dive, but there’s no way you could possibly perceive it as even causal fine dining. Think local neighborhood bar and grille. So we have wine, hell, we have more than 2 wines! We gotta couple red, and a couple white. 

The white wines are shoved in the bottle of the beer cooler while the red wines are kept in a wine cooler chilled to just slightly below room temperature as any good Som knows to do....OH WAIT! NO THEYRE NOT! Because they are less than $11 at the grocery store, and as I said, we’re not that kind of joint. We keep them displayed on the bar top, which happens to be directly across from Karen’s seat. I should also mention, that our AC is garbage on a hot day w/ 5 people in the restaurant, therefore it is almost non existent on a hot day with 100 people in the building. Okay, now you get the whole vibe of my place. 

So bartender drops the wine and runs away to do more shit. Pretty soon, there’s Karen, wandering into the service station, demanding a manager. My GM rolls up to help her, she shoves the glass into her hand and announces, “My wine is way too hot.” GM glances at the glass, and says, “Oh, yeah, we don’t chill our red, so I have some cold white if you’d like that instead?” Karen insists it’s still too hot but turns her heel and heads back to her seat. 

Meanwhile, with Karen gone, my bartender finally has a second and is checking up on her current guests. She comes to Karen’s friend and asks how’s she’s doing. Karen’s friend responds w/ a little nonsense and nearly falling out of her chair. Do bartender pulls her glass and goes up to me and GM to let us know, she be cutting a bitch off for falling out of her chair. 

We say do you boo boo and think nothing else of it. Until that is, Karen comes charging us again. “EXCUSE ME, bartender refused to give my friend and I new glasses of WINE.” 

GM, “Oh yeah, she says your friend is intoxicated so she can’t drink anymore.” 

“ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? SHE IS NOT DRUNK, BESIDES, WERE UBERING, WERE ADULTS FOR GOD’S SAKE!!”

GM: “Okay, well sorry, she’s my bartender and I’ve gotta back her up if she cuts someone off.”

Karen looks at me, and I just kinda shrug at her. 

And then she screams, “YOUR JUAT HORRIBLE.....YOU’RE ALL JUST HORRIBLE!!!!!”

Karen grabs her barstool slumping drunk middle aged bitch friend and walks her tab. Of course, she must have been too fucked up herself to remember, that the bar takes the card of anyone they don’t know personally during events...cuz ya know, drunk fucks. 

We had quite a laugh at the end of the night when we realized. I did end up comping her check they just had a side and the too hot wine, and in my GM’s words, “I don’t ever want to see that bitches face again.”

I’m just hoping against hope she does the walk of shame to get her card, doubtful, but damn it must have been amazing when she realized.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this past weekend at my work we had a really big annual event.

I don’t really know where else to post this so I’m posting here. I’ve been in the service industry for almost five years now at a variety of places. I’ve been at my current restaurant for a year now. We have had a lot of issues with management and our wonderful gm is leaving because the other managers treat her like shit.

One manager is the bar manager. She has openly admitted that she doesn’t give a shit about the servers. She threatens us with write ups all the time, makes us pay for drinks that customers send back because they didn’t like, as well as overstaffs the floor so we don’t make any money. She likes to blame the servers for the decline in business and say that it’s our fault that the restaurant is a mess all the time ignoring the fact it’s a mess from the late night scene when she is the only manager on duty. Lots of time the servers come in during mornings on weekends to broken glass and trash everywhere. There have been several time that me or other people have to clean up vomit from the previous night because she doesn’t have anyone clean it up.

The latest thing she has going on is that this Saturday she wants to do an ocktober fest special. She gave us notice last week that all servers are required to wear dirndl skirts or lederhosen. After looking at prices many of us asked if it was mandatory because we don’t have the money to buy a costume to wear for one day. The GM who is leaving next week said she would bring it up in their manager meeting. Today the GM send me a text apologizing saying that the bar manager is making it mandatory and she will write up anyone who doesn’t wear a costume.

Am I being ridiculous for being angry? In previous restaurants, management has given us the option to dress up for different holidays but it was never mandatory. Nor was it we had to wear specific costumes that cost a decent amount of money. On top of that, we were given a week and a half notice to buy a costume. Ignoring the fact that most servers are working 40 to 50 hours a week because she won’t hire anyone else or cut the amount of servers on a shift. Most of us either have a second job or are full time students and don’t have time to go costume shopping. 

Also they made us dress up this past July for a Christmas in July special. At least that time they provided us with stuff to wear but it looked so stupid none of our tables took us seriously and our tips suffered.

I almost want to find a way to put the restaurant on blast on the internet but figured that was me being petty. I’m just tired of us servers being treated like shit.

(TL;DR at bottom)

Hello fellow redditors, long time reader of y'alls posts and just wanted to share a story from a few weeks ago. 

So this actually happened the night before I came in to work, (happened on a Thursday I believe and I worked Friday), and everyone found out about it when we came in. 

One of our hosts gets a call around 8:30, an hour and a half before close, in which the person asks to speak to a manager, so the host redirects the call. Our closing manager picks up the phone and  it immediately just goes bonkers from here. The caller says that they are from corporate and to not tell anyone about the call, because it is of the upmost importance that no one finds about the dastardly things going on. Caller says that our sushi restaurant, which is part of a chain, is under investigation because the other managers, who the caller knew by name somehow, have been into some shady sh*t. 

So this goes on for sometime and the caller manages to convince my closing manager that the only way to remedy this whole situation is to take over two grand from the safe, go and buy as many prepaid VISA gift cards as possible, send them to him, and then cut up the cards and the receipts. Now this is ridiculous and as much of a red flag as you can ask for, but my manager does it, as well as sending all her social security info, and other personal information as well! 

The significant other of my manager called later that night, after said manager had taken the money and gone, and said that everything would be explained later. 

AND THEN NOTHING WAS EVER EXPLAINED!

We all came in to work, were told, and proceeded to lose our collective minds because of how insane this all was, as well as the fact that we wouldn't be getting our tips at the end of the night because the safe had less money in it than it should have. 

So thank you all for for your wonderful posts and I hope mine brings you the amazement that it did to me when experiencing it!

&lt;p&gt;(TL;DR at bottom)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello fellow redditors, long time reader of y&amp;#39;alls posts and just wanted to share a story from a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this actually happened the night before I came in to work, (happened on a Thursday I believe and I worked Friday), and everyone found out about it when we came in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our hosts gets a call around 8:30, an hour and a half before close, in which the person asks to speak to a manager, so the host redirects the call. Our closing manager picks up the phone and  it immediately just goes bonkers from here. The caller says that they are from corporate and to not tell anyone about the call, because it is of the upmost importance that no one finds about the dastardly things going on. Caller says that our sushi restaurant, which is part of a chain, is under investigation because the other managers, who the caller knew by name somehow, have been into some shady sh*t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this goes on for sometime and the caller manages to convince my closing manager that the only way to remedy this whole situation is to take over two grand from the safe, go and buy as many prepaid VISA gift cards as possible, send them to him, and then cut up the cards and the receipts. Now this is ridiculous and as much of a red flag as you can ask for, but my manager does it, as well as sending all her social security info, and other personal information as well! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significant other of my manager called later that night, after said manager had taken the money and gone, and said that everything would be explained later. &lt;/p&gt;

It clear that you have twisted reality, you were asked to leave twice for being abusive towards one of our team about his country of origin and your behaviour is unacceptable and shameful.  


This situation could almost be deemed laughable if it wasn't for the shocking content of your tirade. Posting this review is particularly bizarre because you seemed to show remorse the second time and you said you felt disgusted by your own behaviour. And now you are endeavouring to ruin the livelihood of the very person you were abusive towards by attacking the business he's a valued member of.  


You have made a public declaration that you won't be back and we are relieved that we won't have to endure another horrible encounter with you.

I’ve worked in this slightly nicer (on the surface at least) diner/borderline restaurant with a bakery attached as well for about two years now. The first year was great, and I freaking loved my job. N I made friends that I love soo much. After a little while a new owner from out of town took over the diner. He was basically the same as the old owner but he was new. I’d been there far longer at this point. And things stayed great for awhile. The new gm really liked me so I was riding high for awhile. When I kind of confronted him with the reality of our situation-that we could never rly be a thing and we shouldn’t waste each other’s time, risk our jobs, blah blah blah-he was not cool about it. And  then things started to suck. I don’t want to put too many details out there but a lot of it involved some dirty laundry belonging to this manager...and favoritism issues arising from that. Is that vague enough? I’m sorry, but basically this place was a living breathing soap opera with so much gossip and drama that your head would spin, not to even mention the drug problem. 

Anyway, things have been building for awhile and tonight I just lost it. I got into a huge argument with the owner, who normally doesn’t give me the time of day. We fought, he didn’t listen to a word I said, and I just left. Didn’t clock out, didn’t finish my sidework, didn’t get my credit card tips or do my tip out (tho I’m sure the support staff got their $ from those tips bc mine were def enough to cover tipout). I couldn’t take anymore. This job was literally making my life miserable and I couldn’t be bothered to even try to fix things.

I’m currently getting very drunk so I can pass out and deal with this tomorrow. I’m supposed to be off anyway. And I actually already secured a new job interview for tomorrow so there’s that.


I’m just freaking out, I don’t want to be unemployed...no one does. I’ll be ok tho rite ?

Is that vague enough? I’m sorry, but basically this place was a living breathing soap opera with so much gossip and drama that your head would spin, not to even mention the drug problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, things have been building for awhile and tonight I just lost it. I got into a huge argument with the owner, who normally doesn’t give me the time of day. We fought, he didn’t listen to a word I said, and I just left. Didn’t clock out, didn’t finish my sidework, didn’t get my credit card tips or do my tip out (tho I’m sure the support staff got their $ from those tips bc mine were def enough to cover tipout). I couldn’t take anymore. This job was literally making my life miserable and I couldn’t be bothered to even try to fix things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently getting very drunk so I can pass out and deal with this tomorrow. I’m supposed to be off anyway. And I actually already secured a new job interview for tomorrow so there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just freaking out, I don’t want to be unemployed...no one does. I’ll be ok tho rite ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, yes, lesson learned—do not get involved IN ANY WAY with your boss!&lt;/p&gt;

We haven’t seen each other in a few years. Tonight he happened to be in town for work, and I happened to be free, so we met at a restaurant to catch up. He and I already have incredibly different views on life. He is in his mid-20’s and still lives with our mom, doesn’t pay bills or understand how the world works, but has very strong opinions on how the world *should* work (this is relevant because it affects his perspective on tipping).

We civilly debate a few things throughout dinner, and all is well. We’ve always “argued” (as our mom always called it) and it’s not usually something we did in anger- just an exchanging of ideas, a genuine debate.

The check for dinner comes, and he’s already insisted it’s his treat. Having spent over 5 years in the serving industry, I bluntly ask how much the bill is, and how much he intends to tip. He says, “I’ve heard it’s supposed to be 20%, but it was 10-15% when I first started eating out, so that’s what I do now.” And opens up the argument about how paying employees shouldn’t be the customer’s responsibility.

He knows I feel strongly about the serving industry, tipping, and server’s rights. To him, this is an opening for another friendly debate. He didn’t realize *our* server was taking an order at the booth behind my him, and said server was subtly listening in.

I reply, “It’s 20%, because the server deserves to earn a decent tip after deductions. How much are you going to tip? Because I’ll make up the difference in cash.” As the server finishes up and walks BOH.

He hastily insists that he’ll tip 20%, and starts to sign the receipt. He says the total of the bill, and calculates that $9 would be just over 20%, so that’s what he’ll leave. He signs it, closes the book, and sets it on the table (we’re at a booth sitting on opposite sides, so I can’t actually see the receipt from where I’m sitting). Out of curiosity, I grabbed it to be sure, and guess what?? $6 on $44. Now we’re going back and forth (still civilly of course) about how he lied and all of the reasons what he did wasn’t okay. Not really having an argument or justification, he says something like “well, okay, I didn’t realize it was such a big deal.” and accepts defeat (not as crazy as it sounds with us, because of how we debate).

I put a $10 in the book (and I inform him I’m leaving extra because our poor server had to hear what he said about under-tipping), we chat about a few other things for a moment, then we hug and part ways.

I just wanted to share because I think I got through to him. At least I hope. I will never let him off the hook knowing he’s tipped less than 20% for *good* service. 20% should be where it *starts* for good service.

Edit for TLDR: my brother lied and said he tipped 20% after arguing about how 10-15% is a good tip within ear shot of our server. He left $6 on $44.

(sorry in advance for my english)

Little background here, I moved away from my abusive family last year and, having to support myself financially, the easiest job for me to find was as a waitress.

I worked in different kind of restaurants for the past year, until this summer I was hired at this very convenient place, just a 10 min walk from my apartment! I was overjoyed. Until I had to deal with the owner...
He is the most lazy, unprofessional, rude, unorganized, did I say *unprofessional*!!! boss I ever had to deal with. Constantly standing at the cashier blowing vape on customers (!!!), doing absolutely nothing to help us waiters (I’d be fine with this, if he didn’t constantly stop one of the staff to ask them to pour him a glass of grappa) and treating his employees like they’re just puppets at his service while he thinks his restaurant is the best in the whole town (.... it’s not... it’s basically a tourist trap)

I endured it for a while, cause it was a busy season and I really needed the money, plus the staff was actually nice and teached me a LOT about the job. But I have so many stories about this guy.
For instance, I never actually know when my day off is. He calls me to tell me when to come in and sometimes I have no choice but to remind him that, Hey, Tomorrow Is Sunday And I Have Worked Every Day? Lunch and dinner? Can’t You Call Other People? (it annoys him so much when I do that, but how is he so bad at organizing shifts for his employees? he does nothing! his wife deals with ordering stuff for the bar and kitchen and basically everything else!)

Anyways, sorry for the rant but he drives me mad lol. The good thing is, I applied for a job at a popular chain opening next week and I got hired! I’ve already worked in the company at another location last winter and I loved it, but I had to leave because I moved to another town.

We start the night with our briefing, and we are told of this couple who have been going to many of our hotel properties, and have been complaining at every single one of them. They had dinner at our other hotel restaurant last night, and complained about the food, complained about a scratch on the table and told in their most condescending tone that we should be put linen on such tables, and also had complains about our breakfast buffet this morning. And my manager low key tells me they never tipped anyone through all that. GREAT.

Man finishes his meal, asks for his check, and as I'm clearing looks me in the eye and says : ''I enjoyed that''

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a short and sweet one for you tonight.&lt;br/&gt;
We start the night with our briefing, and we are told of this couple who have been going to many of our hotel properties, and have been complaining at every single one of them. They had dinner at our other hotel restaurant last night, and complained about the food, complained about a scratch on the table and told in their most condescending tone that we should be put linen on such tables, and also had complains about our breakfast buffet this morning. And my manager low key tells me they never tipped anyone through all that. GREAT.  &lt;/p&gt;

Church people

I had a table on a Sunday afternoon that was ok. They weren’t combative, but they weren’t accepting, either. Just a table of four. 
Towards the end of their meal, the Man (who had announced at the beginning of the meal that he was paying) showed me a little baby-bible and asked if I had ever read it. I answered, honestly, that I had read and owned a bible, but I had never seen one that small. 
He, immediately, tried to quote a scripture (can’t remember which one, but it was in psalms, I remember that much) and as I spoke it with him, he just stopped. 
After their meal, he left NO TIP. But he left his little baby bible as a tip. That bible had “Gideon” stamped on it. The Gideons give out bibles. So, that man thought a free bible he got was a “tip” for a waitress that had told him she owned several bibles (the most important being my confirmation bible, which is white with gold print). 
Stop with that shit. Stop thinking the “word” is a tip. As Jesus said, “Give unto God what is God’s and give unto Caesar what is Caesar’s”.

I was in complete shock because I have NEVER had a complaint, and have been told by other Fronts that I’m pretty good. 

I walk away, start crying, the manager becomes involved but John is still being a dick. No other employees were there but the bar tender.

He starts asking me if I even value the job, I don’t take it seriously, and I don’t deserve to work there. Doesn’t like that I joke around, etc. This is out of nowhere, and I am seriously taken aback. I ask him what had happened, because we were vibing really well up until that point. Seems he has been sneaking alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is raising his voice, and I told him that he was scaring me. John continues by telling me I am the worst back in the restaurant, and lists all the people I am worse than. It kept going and going!! This lasts about five minutes of me trying to talk to him calmly, but he wouldn’t let me interject. I was in complete shock because I have NEVER had a complaint, and have been told by other Fronts that I’m pretty good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walk away, start crying, the manager becomes involved but John is still being a dick. No other employees were there but the bar tender. I left feeling embarrassed, ashamed, and afraid to work with him again. I don’t think he will have any true repercussions because our restaurant doesn’t have an HR, and he’s been working there for so long. What the fuck do I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr - coworker told me how much of a useless person I am, how much I sucked, all unwarranted. He was drunk on the job berating me. He probably won’t lose his job, and I’m not sure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

Short staffed and the staff we did have was definitely the b team. (Except me, obviously lol.) just not a good group. 

Today is my Friday and after this hot mess of a weekend I actually considered calling in. I knew I would have totally screwed the other servers so I didn’t. 
We have a Monday special that is Fucking terrible. It creates double the work for us and no one ever tips extra for what we discount and I.HATE.MONDAYS. 

Well we got slammed. Every table in the restaurant was full with 4 servers. 4 servers, 2 cooks and one single manager. 
34 tables and a party room. Full. 

We were basically running in between tables. Today’s crew was super solid so we were only slightly drowning. Our manager was stuck cashing people out and a table came in and was waiting. Two adult ladies and a kid around 10 months old. No highchair for the kid which was honestly super weird. Just a booster. 

Well, it took a minute for one of us to even have the time to notice the door so when I had I minute I went and grabbed them and took them to the only empty table in the restaurant, which happened to be mine that I had JUST cleaned. 

I get them sat and ask for drinks and the Karen says “JUST SO YOU KNOW, WEVE BEEN WAITING TEN MINUTES.”
I apologize and explain it was a special day and that I was so sorry but that I would get them taken care of right away. My manager had tried to greet them from behind the register but they ignored him. 

I grab drinks and run back and ask if they are ready to order and they send me away. I think nothing of it, run among my 7 other tables and stop back by a couple minutes later. 

This is where shit gets real. 

I go back to the table and ask if they are ready. The younger lady says she is and orders an app and her meal. I look to the Karen to order and she says(I cannot even make this up) “I don’t know what I want because I DONT HAVE A MENU.” I honestly just look at her. I sat them with two menus. She continues. 
“I don’t have a menu because SHE (the BABY) THREW IT ON THE FLOOR. SHE THROWS EVERYTHING ON THE FLOOR.” I just...I just was silent. 

I have never in my life been stunned like this Karen stunned me. 

She could not be bothered to PICK UP THE GODDAMN MENU OFF THE FLOOR. Or, OR, use her dining partners menu. 
She literally was pissed at me because the baby at the table tossed her menu on the floor under her feet and it was apparently my job to notice that (we have a regular menu and a specialty/seasonal menu...so honestly it wasn’t obvious she had no menu) her menu was no longer on the table.

$3 tip on a $33 tab.

Because a BABY threw her menu on the floor and she didn’t want to pick it up.

We’ve actually had an issue with them since we opened, and we’ve voiced our concerns many times to our managers, but for some reason this is the only time we’ve heard anything from him about it. He really doesn’t know what he’s doing running a restaurant, but there’s enough about him for another post.


So our issue with Grub Hub is that it often takes a ridiculously long time for drivers to be assigned to orders. Idk what they’re doing, but none of the other apps we use have this issue. I understand that we can’t always expect an order to be picked up right away, but it’s a problem that we have orders that sit completed for upwards of 30 minutes while other orders on the same app get picked up in less than 10 minutes even tough they came in after the one that’s been sitting. And it’s not just a handful of cases. It’s multiple orders every day.  We waste so much time calling customer support, and taking calls from angry customers, all while needing to keep up with the next 3 orders that come in. It also doesn’t help that the very same owner who was scolding us for the low rating keeps pushing for lower labor costs. We’re understaffed, and stressed all the time. I personally have to turn Seamless orders off every day that I work. When I’m scheduled for the back of house, I always end up being called to the front because of backed up mobile orders. I frequently have to put prepping on hold to answer calls from customers wondering where their food is.


This has reached a boiling point for me because we had 4 orders get canceled because of this during the night shift alone. Seamless is supposed to be the most used app in NYC. This shouldn’t be an issue. When we call customer service, we shouldn’t get excuses. It’s gotten to the point where I want to quit, but with my schedule, I don’t have the time to set up interviews, and because we’re so short staffed, it’s nearly impossible to to find someone to cover a shift.

They do. This is how it worked.

This was an incredibly busy restaurant, with high menu prices and good tippers. Servers could easily make $300+ in a double, which is impressive for this smaller city. They treat new hires horribly, with vets getting slightly more privilege (better sections, better shifts, and only vets could shift-lead), but they treat all employees as if they’re drill sergeants and the employees are their soldiers- including degrading, shaming, and humiliation.

Every 2 weeks, you’d get a paycheck where all of your credit card tips were calculated, and the negative balance is what you would normally pay during tax season. It would normally either be deducted from your refund, or be part of what you owe the IRS. But somehow, this restaurant was able to force servers to pay that negative balance on each check- in fact, if they couldn’t, they weren’t allowed to work. When I worked there, the worst I had was -$300, and usually it was less. Everyone knows it isn’t quite right, but apparently they’re still getting away with this.

This Sunday I essentially served 30 people and paid for it. A little backstory the restaurant I work at we only get three table sections, sounds kinda shitty but you can make decent money if you upsell and turn tables as fast as you can. We also have a rule that any table over 8 guests requires 2 servers and the more guests the more servers “needed”. 

I arrive for my dinner shift at 4:00pm I’m informed that there’s a 30 top reserved for 5:00pm, they hold 2 of my 3 tables that are required for the party for an hour until the guests show up basically meaning I only get to serve one table in that time. At 5:00pm 4 woman show up and start decorating the table with plastic clothes, table runners and napkins, this somehow takes them about 45 minutes and the rest of the guests show up at 6:00pm an hour after the reservation time which is fine I guess I just knew they’d be there for awhile.

Everyone is finally seated after about ten minutes of standing and talking in the way of other guests. I should probably mention they didn’t want to pay for a private room so we had to accommodate them with pushed together tables obviously surrounded by a pod of other guests. I’m not sure where they were from but they had very thick accents, a little hard to understand but that’s okay I just took extra time to answer menu questions and ensure I got their order correct. As I’m taking orders shit starts to go south, the birthday girl shows up in a fur coat, tiara and sash. As soon as she is seen the entire table breaks out into a five minute customized happy birthday rendition among the 15 other tables trying to eat. I will add we aren’t allowed to sing happy birthday (weird rule) because it disturbs other patrons but guests can do it if they wish. Which they did, extremely loud and for extremely long. 

We get all the orders and right before the food comes out everyone leaves to go outside and take pictures for 15 minutes, obviously coming back to cold food, yea they complained and yes most of it was remade. I would say this is my bad for not leaving it in the window but we were busy and had no room to keep that much food on the line. Fast forward they finish eating and start singing AGAIN as I mentioned before they had accents not sure where they were from and the song they were singing was in a different language, doesn’t really make a difference I just cant include what song they were singing. They did this 3 TIMES. Stayed in the restaurant for 5 hours and left me and my 2 coworkers also serving them exactly 0 dollars on a 700$ tab. I only got my 3rd table sat once because no one wanted to sit anywhere near this party because of how rude and loud they were being. The one table I had got their check comped because the birthday girl and some of the women were taking pictures in front of the table with their butts 2 inches from the food. 

So after my tip out to the bartender and food runner I literally made negative money that night but had a decent cry in the bar cooler. My manager lets large parties like these make reservations without a contracted event all the time and everyone suffers for it, nothing I can do about it but bitch here though. Gotta love Sunday’s!

Anyway, he came up to me the second I was out of sight of my boss. I lit my smoke and suddenly this guy is all up in my face going off about how I got his order wrong and all this bullshit.

Stupid shit. I got mad, but I wasn't responding to his crap.

A friend who is a regular customer at the cafe came over to us on his way out and asked if anything was wrong, only to become another victim of verbal abuse, and then the guy started threatening him saying he better square up cause he was about to get hit for butting in. This is where I spoke up and told the guy that what he was saying was inappropriate, to leave my friend alone, that he only came over to make sure i was okay, which I wasn't, and told him that if he kept going the way he was going then I would be more than happy to call the police. Then he spat on me. All over my face, my food, my coffee, my smoke.

I don't know how I did it, but I walked away, friend in tow. Straight to centre management to ask if they had security cameras that could see the area where it happened. They don't, but the cafe does have surveillance footage of him ordering food, me making his order CORRECTLY, and him waiting outside the grocery store eating his food then following me around the corner. I filed a police report along with my friend as a witness, and had my boss take a copy of the footage to the cop shop, only to be told ""there's nothing we can do because we don't have any proof of the alleged assault"".  Apparently a young woman all shaken up, a young man with the exact same story, and surveillance footage of a man waiting outside the store and pointedly following the young woman out of sight is not sufficient enough evidence for them to actually lift a finger and even TRY to build a case.

&lt;p&gt;A friend who is a regular customer at the cafe came over to us on his way out and asked if anything was wrong, only to become another victim of verbal abuse, and then the guy started threatening him saying he better square up cause he was about to get hit for butting in. This is where I spoke up and told the guy that what he was saying was inappropriate, to leave my friend alone, that he only came over to make sure i was okay, which I wasn&amp;#39;t, and told him that if he kept going the way he was going then I would be more than happy to call the police. Then he spat on me. All over my face, my food, my coffee, my smoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how I did it, but I walked away, friend in tow. Straight to centre management to ask if they had security cameras that could see the area where it happened. They don&amp;#39;t, but the cafe does have surveillance footage of him ordering food, me making his order CORRECTLY, and him waiting outside the grocery store eating his food then following me around the corner. I filed a police report along with my friend as a witness, and had my boss take a copy of the footage to the cop shop, only to be told &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s nothing we can do because we don&amp;#39;t have any proof of the alleged assault&amp;quot;.  Apparently a young woman all shaken up, a young man with the exact same story, and surveillance footage of a man waiting outside the store and pointedly following the young woman out of sight is not sufficient enough evidence for them to actually lift a finger and even TRY to build a case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk what to do, but I know I&amp;#39;m not looking forward to work tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm finishing up end of week inventory, and one of my servers comes up and says, ""I'm about to go off on 41."" I ask what's up and she tells me he's being kinda racist, asking her if she has a green card, or filled out an I-9. I go out to see if I can get a vibe from this table and see another server talking to them. It's two dudes, and one is speaking loudly about how we ""need to get rid of these spicy women, and just have burly bearded dudes as servers."" I'm bearded and tattooed, but at 5'7 and 140lbs I wouldn't consider myself burly, but dude still grabs my arm after I approach the table and says, ""like this guy.""

I ask him to let go of me and if everything is ok with his meal. He says yes, everything is fine. Its 30min til close, only one other couple at the bar. Figure, ""maybe since I made an appearance and made it known I'm the manager he'll cool it down."" I tell the server I'll finish the table out, and I hang around up front just in case. Of course, he chooses to keep running his mouth. ""What is Margarrrrrrrrrrita's problem, I wonder?"" rolling hard on the r's, some ""mucho caliente"" shit and just other thinly veiled racist bullshit. I go over and politely, calmly, but firmly tell him I will not tolerate guest abusing my staff, racial or otherwise. He tries to play dumb, says he doesnt know what I'm talking about. I tell him he's a grown man and knows damn well what I'm talking about, and reiterate that it will not be tolerated. Do we have an understanding? Yes? Good. Have a lovely meal.

But of course, he couldnt let it go. So, I tell him we dont want his business and ask him to leave. He claims ""the Mexican stole his card"" and he's not leaving until he gets it back. She didnt. Check hadn't even been dropped. He insists. I suggest we call the police to get to the bottom of this. He relents, and magically finds his card in his wallet.

Had a woman the other day who came in for lunch with her friend. Everything seemed to start off well enough, jokes were had, they were smiling, and I had a nice confident feeling things would go smoothly with them. However, the end of the meal took a sour turn. 

But what bothers me is now I can’t tell if she was joking about things or I’m stupid and she wasn’t joking at first. So here we go, here’s my list of what confuses me...

1) She ordered an alcoholic drink, asked if it was good and I said it was awesome cause we make our own infused alcohol for it. Her friend asks her if she’s drinking during lunch and she just gives me a stern look like I just got her in trouble. Then she starts laughing and says “of course not”. I bring the drink over and all seems well. 

2) When I bring the drink over, she asks if that is the one she ordered, and I jokingly said that it’s our raspberry lemonade. Her friend laughs and she just stared at me. Okay, I’m not a great comedian, but the joke wasn’t offensive and the drink is the same color as the lemonade...I was just playing off the stern look from earlier that seemed to be a joke. 

3) When she ordered a dessert to-go and I asked if she needed a plastic fork for it. She just blankly stared at me and asked me why she would need the fork. I guess my confidence was still running high and I suggested that maybe she was on her lunch break and would want to enjoy it at her desk later...that is if her coworkers haven’t seen her Togo bag with our very obvious name on it. Again, she just stared...while her friend laughed and explained that I’m suggesting her coworkers might steal her dessert. She just said she’s not going back to work. Okay, this woman might hate me and I don’t know why, I shall not speak anymore than required. Hint taken. 

4) As I’m going to drop of their split checks, I was also running another drink to my other table. Her face lit up and she said the drink was very pretty and wanted to know what it is. I responded with the name and start describing it to her...and she cut me off with “I asked what it was, not what was in it, thanks” I mean, I literally felt my smile fall and my eyes met the floor. I could feel my eyes starting to water and I just simply left the books and walked away. Her tone was just so incredibly bitchy and rude that I couldn’t even raise my eyes to wish them a nice day. 

...and that is that. I’ve been serving for ten years and I normally can pick up on tables vibes. But this one really confused me. Her friend was laughing and joking back, while being very polite...hell, she left me 25%! The mean one left me $0.05. I’ve been replaying in my head and I just don’t get it. I don’t feel as though I offended her, but her demeanor was just so off...and to be so rude to me at the end, I just don’t get it. Part of me feels like maybe she has a drinking problem and I made her feel bad in front of her friend? Or maybe she just didn’t like my jokes?

I offered to replace the second one, and she had this to say:

""It's obvious that one of your cooks is having a rough day and he's taking it out on the food. I don't take it personal. I'll pray that he finds happiness in his heart. We don't live too far away and we come here all the time. We love TGIChilibees. Everyone has bad days and this is just one of his bad days. We'll come back and hopefully he's having a better day.

I left for my different position and the person that I was serving was so needy. She just wanted to snap her fingers and have things done right away. She would stare at me and the other servers, making us feel uncomfortable and ask all of us individually for something that she needed.

I didnt think too much of the party until it was over and she had to pay. I overheard the sales rep say that this was a fancy place so of course the bill was going to be expensive. I think it was at this point where she tried to point out all of these little things that she didnt like even though the party went great.

There were no large plates available and I had to look around the dish pit and ask the dishwasher for those plates and I brought them all out as soon as possible.

We didnt expect to be waited on at that time or order drinks or anything for that matter just purely wanted a table with the doggo.

So next week they have a new manager &amp;quot;shadowing&amp;quot; me and then &amp;quot;training&amp;quot; with me. None of the other managers have ever done this. I&amp;#39;m not even a supervisor. There&amp;#39;s no training guide. What do I do? How do I approach training my superior? Why do you think they&amp;#39;re doing this to me? Reassurance needed, I&amp;#39;m worried this will lead to something bad happening.&lt;/p&gt;

Been lurking for a while, but I started my first bar job a couple of months ago so I can finally add my own tales! This one’s not super exciting, but I just wanted to share the dumb I have to deal with almost every day.

For a bit of context, I work at a racket and fitness club that the public enter, but people can pay a monthly membership and with that they get a card that all bar transactions go through and it gives them a discount on everything. This means we do a lot of card top ups in a day.

The specific night I’m talking about happened 2 days ago, and it was a special day as half the bar was closed off for the funeral wake of an ex-member. This meant that all the regulars were pushed into half the space they were used to, so the bar area was a little hectic. However, at the point of the story, the funeral party had almost all gone so me and my co-workers were managing well.

This is when Moron enters. Moron is a regular member that I am very familiar with because he is most definitely not the brightest crayon in the packet. He’s not a bad guy, but every interaction with him leaves me a little drained. He orders 8 various drinks and I know for certain that he will not have enough money on his members card because he never does. These drinks take FOREVER to pour because he’ll order 2 at a time, fuck off for a couple of minutes to talk to someone and then come back and say ‘But I’m not finished!’ when I ask for his card. He also keeps forgetting what he’s already ordered and I have to keep reminding him.

Eventually all the drinks are done and he finally passes me his members card. And lo and behold, he has about £3 on it. So I come back with the card machine and tell him that it needs to be topped up.

At this point, the funeral party has officially left the building, so our manager decides to bring all the left-over food we prepared for it to the other side of the room and offer it to the members. This guy, as he was reaching for his wallet, forgets everything but the food that is suddenly in front of him. The plates have not even reached the bar top, and he is grabbing handfuls of this finger food to shove in his face. And I mean shove. I watched him inhale thick slices of pork pie and two layer sandwich without breathing. The rest of the members are still asking what the sandwiches are as they are entering his mouth. Clearly he does not care what it is as long as it’s free. I am more then a little bit disgusted, but I’m still trying to get payment out of him.

Eventually, I get enough of his attention for him to ask, spitting bread at me as he does: ‘Well, have you taken my money yet?’

To which I have to respond ‘No, because you’ve haven’t given me your fucking debit card’ - minus the swearing. So, finally, he pulls his card out of his wallet...to get distracted by sausage rolls behind him. He steps AWAY from the bar, debit card still in hand, to stuff sausage rolls in his mouth in a way that would make pigs ashamed.

After a minute more of this he turns and demands to know why I haven’t charged him yet to which I just point at his card, because my customer smile can only stay on for so long. His response is to slam it onto the bar top and go ‘Well, take it then!’ like I haven’t been trying to do that for the last 5 minutes. 

But it’s fine. I’ve got it now. He can continue shovelling food and I can finally serve someone else.

You’d think that would be the end to the story...but no. About 15 minutes later, Moron is standing at the bar with some friends who are buying the next round and he starts making very loud, pained noises. I put a beer in front of him, and he immediately starts demanding to know what was wrong with the food he’d just ate. Apparently his stomach was feeling bad, so he starts yelling across the bar ‘That’s why it was free, wasn’t it?! There’s something wrong with it!!!’

My response, in the most polite and joyful tone I could muster was ‘There’s nothing wrong with the food, we served the same stuff to a funeral party. I think the problem is how much food you forced into your mouth in such a short amount of time.’

He answered with something along the lines of ‘Well I always eat like that!’ which left me slightly horrified, but not surprised.

I finished my shift a little after that, but apparently he kept on about for a while until his friends told him to shut up and they went clubbing, so I guess he stomach wasn’t hurting that much.

TLDR: Moron gets distracted by food while I try to get his card off him, then demands to know why he hasn’t paid. Then complains the food was bad but still goes clubbing","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there!

I’ve been in the service industry for ~16 years now. My skin is much thicker than it was when I started in my early 20s. Last night it felt so thin I thought it was translucent. 

A bit of the lead up to the break. My night started out well, I came in at 3 and knew I was closing because it’s the one night a week we do karaoke. Which is a nightmare in and of itself. 

We have a lot of younger staff, it’s a small place (12 tables) so there’s usually only 3 servers and a bartender. There’s a lot of stress here due to the owners, husband and wife, and the way the wife thinks she needs to treat the servers. She used to be principal of a grade school, and treats us all like children. 

I have to help a lot because of the teenagers/YA I work with. We have auto-grat for 8 or more. This is important. 

One of the tables was being absolute dicks to their server. They were dicks to me too, but I only had one small interaction with them. They asked where their bread basket was and I said we don’t offer that, but if they’d like to order a side of garlic toast I could make that happen. 

The server didn’t want to get stiffed on this 6 top, so she added an auto-grat and this table went nuclear. Beforehand she asked me and the bartender if she should grat and we said no, it’s a terrible idea, and there’s only 6. She did it anyways.  They asked for the manager, and there wasn’t one in the building so the bartender stepped in. He’s the “acting manager” when the owners aren’t there. There is no actual manager for this place. 

The reason they went nuclear? Me. How rude and uncooperative I was for not bringing them bread. That’s not even a choice I have. The kitchen won’t hand out anything without a ticket. Not even a side of mayo. 

The owner came in a while later and got the lowdown, then I got talked to about tipping and how we shouldn’t expect it. WTF. It wasn’t even my table and I had nothing to do with it besides the bread crisis. 

Side note: We have a loyalty program, spend $150 and get $25 off. When I use the discount I write original total on the check, that’s what I’m getting taxed on and tipping out on.  The tip out is 5% of my total sales. 

The tip conversation turned into the owner telling me I’m not allowed to write the original total on checks. Whatever.

This just made me aggravated because the whole issue arose because this younger server broke the auto-grat rules and I end up getting the brunt of it. 

I don’t lose sleep over bad tips, I figure it all comes out in the wash. 

I moved on with my night. Then karaoke happened. We had a group of regulars come in with out of town family. They ran their check up to ~$175.00. If they wouldn’t have been there I could’ve gone home around 11, they didn’t close out until almost 1AM. 

So I’ve been killing time, side work and more has been done. All my paperwork is done. I’m literally waiting for their CC slip so I can turn in my papers/money and walk out the door. I’m tired, over people and their entitled BS, and I just want to make the 30 minute drive home. 

I walk by and ask how things are going, and he says loudly to his group and the other regulars I wait on every. single. weekend. that I’m just hassling him because it’s a big check and I don’t want to get stiffed. I have had enough of the night at this point and I loudly said actually I’m really tired, I’ve been here for 10 hours and just need his slip to get out of there. I was out of F’s to give at this point. Also, I was so embarrassed. 

That’s when I broke, when my integrity had been insulted for the 2nd time that night. I was embarrassed and my feelings were super hurt. I started crying, not ugly crying, but crying nonetheless. 

I got my paperwork turned in and decided to have a cocktail. I was sitting at part of the bar that isn’t super visible. I can’t explain without this story getting waaaaay longer. The wife of the regular walked by where I wasn’t expecting her to and she saw me still crying a bit. Then her husband, the insult guy comes up too. Feck. They are slightly intoxicated but immediately put 2 and 2 together. They apologized profusely, especially the wife. She. was. mad. 

I’m not a crier. It’s not my thing. I was just so tired and insulted that I broke. 

I found a $100 bill in my pocket later, so that was nice.

I am very nice to all my customers and I can handle rude customers very well, but what happened yesterday was just absolutely ridiculous.

I work as a server in a movie theater. We still serve normal popcorn and drinks but also serve restaurant food. I had one woman with her group of friends, one of them being her sister, and they all went to see Hustler. When they had their light on I took their orders like normal, and the one woman ordered a drink, chicken tenders, and a pizza for her friends. When i gave her the total and she looked through her purse to pay she then realized she didnt have her wallet on her, but she did have cash (so technically shes been driving around illegally). She asked me to remove the chicken tenders, and she was able to pay for the rest. The order was already sent in and I was busy in 2 other sold out movies at the same time, so I couldnt go to the kitchen to tell them to cancel the tenders. 

When I had the time, I went back to the theater to pick up everybody's dishes, I saw that she was served the chicken tenders and the pizza, which she ate the tenders but the pizza was untouched. I asked if they would like a to go box for the pizza and they said yes. I handed them one, finished putting away the dishes, asking for refills, etc. I went to go prepare the tabs to drop to my customers and that's when I realized that she ate something she didnt pay for. I went back in and I asked if she could pay for the tenders. I can't remember exactly what I said or what she said, so I'm gonna try to get it as close as possible. This is what happened (customer: C, friend: f)

Me: Ma'am, I need the payment for the chicken tenders that you ate

C: what do you mean?

Me: you ate the food that you asked to be cancelled, since you ate it, I need you to pay for it

C: well it's not my fault that it was served to me in the first place 

Me: I understand but you ate the product and you need to pay for it (her friend buts in)

F: well it's your fault that you didnt cancel it and it was served to us

Me: yes I agree with you but why would you still accept something that you didnt pay for

C: well I didnt pay for the tenders but I did pay for the movie so get out of my face and I'll just talk to a manager (I was kneeling down in front of her, trying my hardest to not be in her way of the movie)

To prevent this situation from escalating I left the theatre and went to go find a manager. I told her what was happening and thar she wasnt going to paying for it. She went to go talk to another manager about it and they told me that they would just comp the food off since she didnt have money. I told them that she is in a group and she has other people with her that can pay for it. 

While this was happening I had another co worker experience what happened in the theatre, transferred the tab to herself, and drop off the check to her. I didn't know what she told her. When I went back, I saw the woman storming down the hall with the tab and asked my co worker to come with her to find a manager. I followed far behind, I had no idea what was going on. 

Another co worker working the host stand asked me what was going on and I told her exactly what I said and what they told me. As I was explaining it to her, the customer's sister was walking down the hall and heard me. She started yelling at me in front of other customers (sister: S)

S: YOU NEED TO CHILL OUT. YOU TALKED SO UGLY AND SO RUDE AND YELLED AT US. I WAS GONNA PAY FOR THE TENDERS, BUT YOU ARE BEING SO RUDE. HER HUSBAND IS BRINGING HER WALLET, SO YOU NEED TO CHILL OUT

Me: I'm sorry ma'am but-

S: NO YOURE NOT SORRY

Me: Yes ma'am I really am sorry-

S : NO, NO YOURE NOT (RAISES HER HAND TOWARDS MY FACE IN A SASSY WAY) YOU NEED TO CHILL OUT

She said some other things but I couldnt remember and I kept quiet and waited until she shutup and walked away.

The customers were just staring at us and I was completely embarrassed with how she talked to me. She joined in on the conversation with the managers, and started lying about what i said to them! I know i shouldn't have done this, but I went over close to where they were to try and listen to what she was telling them. When I heard that they were making up their own story I said that is not what happened at all. The sister yelled at me again

S: NO THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED YOU WERE SO RUDE TO US

The customer starts walking towards me and starts yelling in my face

C: YOU NEED TO BE QUIET THIS IS THE REASON WHY YOURE A SERVER AND NOT A MANAGER (uhhhhhh, I dont want to be a manager?)

The manager calmly told me to just walk away

S: (RAISES HAND UP SASSILY AGAIN) YES JUST GO AWAY

My co worker got between me and the customer and walked me away. She told me that she knows those girls from a week ago and they scammed our Assistant General Manager into getting free food, which is what they were doing then.

They both got refunds on ALL of their food, said they were going to talk to corporate about this (corporate already knows who they are and they dont care) and said they are never coming back (thank god)

The General Manager asked me to come to his office and had me explain what happened. I told him exactly what happened and he told me he was on my side. I didnt get in trouble (there was no reason for me to get in trouble in the first place, since I wasnt in the wrong). They were frustrated that they would have to deal with this and explain to corporate and all but they know that I would never do what they said I did. 

The customer posted a review on what happened, and everything she said was all LIES. She posted a different review on another website,  only listing my name and shaming me on there, saying that the younger generation is so inconsiderate and shameful, and that I was a terrible and rude server. 

I was absolutely humiliated and hurt. I have a bad habit of listening to people and not knowing when to not care. I couldn't stop crying once they left the building. The other co workers and managers did their best to cheer me up and make me feel better. I'm glad that I work with such an awesome team. When I told other employees what happened before they got there, they were absolutely surprised and thought I didnt deserve it, because they know how nice I am to everybody.

I was not expecting this to ever happen, because this never happens to me. I am nice to my customers to avoid situations exactly like this. I'm not going to be staying as a server much longer, cause I can't deal with crap like that.

Currently commuting to my job as a manager for TGIChilibees. This happened yesterday. 

I'm running expo when a server comes into the kitchen. 

SERVER: There's a guy at 20 complaining about his steak. 

ME: Overcooked again?

SERVER: No. He says it tastes like lamb. 

Which is something I would never associate our previously frozen, thawed out steaks to ever taste like but whatever. 

I go to the table and it's a family of three. Dad has a burger and mom has pasta, so it's their 20ish year old son. There's half of a steak left on the plate. Red center. Looks pretty good, actually. 

ME: Hey guys. My name is Austin and I heard there was a problem with your steak. 

SON: It tastes like lamb. 

I'm not religious at all, but he was wearing what I can only call a premature turban. Tight around the head and tied (knotted?) in front. The parents are dressed in traditional California attire. The family is Indian. That's all I know. I digress. 

ME: I can assure you that our steaks are 100% beef. I do inventory and I do our orders. If we've ever accidentally recieved lamb, we would return it. 

SON: But it tastes like lamb. How do you know it's not lamb?

ME: I can have a new steak cooked for you if you'd prefer. 

SON: How would I know that the next steak won't be lamb?

We went back and forth for a minute or two. He kept repeating that it tasted like lamb. I kept repeating myself that there's no way we would accidentally receive an order of lamb steaks. I've seen the box they've come in. I've prepared them myself. They're 100% beef. 

I was at the table for maybe ten minutes but it felt like eternity. The parents said nothing. I don't know if the son was trying to prove anything, but I finally gave him the option of finishing his meal or I could replace it with something else.

By now, the parents have finished eating. He has two almost untouched sides and a beef steak that tastes like lamb. 

SON: I'll just finish the steak but we probably won't come back here again. 

ME: Sorry to hear that. Have a good night guys. 

According to their server, he did not finish the steak but they paid for it anyway. 

I really don't know what else I could've said or done except slaughter a cow in front of them but alas, I'm not a butcher. 

I don't know why he didn't believe me. I did ask him to describe the taste, thinking maybe it had spoiled (which happens, but we go through them so fast that they don't hang out in the drawer or walk in for too long. 

He just kept saying it tasted like lamb without describing the traits of lamb. Maybe he was talking out of his ass. I don't know.

Not wanting to be negative, I mentally prepared myself to have a great day and make some money. Unfortunately, my manager had other plans and he had decided the opposite.

 The morning started off fine. Came in and did my opening duties. At about 12 another server came in for her shift (owner's daughter, still training) and we started to get a few tables.

I was left stunned as was new girl. 

As the shift went on, he continued to become more stressed and frustrated. He started speaking down to me in a slowed down way, as if I was stupid. The last straw for me was when he asked me if I was on drugs because I forgot to transfer a reservation into our tablet. I didn't answer and he then asked me if I had been drinking last night and told me he was going to start scheduling me every night so I would stop drinking (no clue where this came from as I stayed home the night before).

At this point I decided I would not finish my shift that night as I refused to be his punching bag. I set up for the night crew and waited until another server came in. I blocked everyone's number and calmly walked out of the back door without looking back. I did message someone to let them know I hadn't dropped dead in a garbage bin.

I drop those off and tell them I'll keep an eye out for when more arrive.  5 minutes later, nothing.  10, nope.  15 minutes, and a teenager shows.  Soda.  Another 15 minutes later, two more teens.  More sodas.  At this point the first 2 got a plate of food.  Ok, I guess you're not waiting for your family? 15 minutes later 3 more adults shows up.  More alcohol.  More alcohol for the first 2 as well.  This trend continued, but the teenagers were quickly gone, barely haven eaten anything.  More adults, more drinks, more leaving, more coming in.  I have an amazing management team, but I warned them this could be problems.  The first two did warn me about separate checks.  I told them I would deal with it later, but this table got chaotic.

Normally, split checks are not problem for me, but I've had countless people leave, and then more come in, a massive amount of liquor ordered...I'm at a loss.  Luckily I don't get stressed.

""Ok, let's do it this way, tell me your first name, how many adults you're paying for, and how much liquor you're paying for.""   They sort of laugh.  I take notes of their answers, and it adds up to 19 people.  There's like 9 people left at the table, multiple teens who has eaten and left, some wives gone...I'll take their word on 19.  They were 2 short on their drinks guesses (most drinking the same draft beer), so I did those two on a separate check and asked who wanted them.  The nice guy picked those up.

That one weird family that stays two hours after close, after spending hours there before. But no, what I had was much worse.

I am a manager at a smallish casual dining restaurant. I've been managing for 3ish months now, and I really like it. Today however, my best friend was the one managing the joint, and I was just closing the lobby. It was 9:02, and it was 3 minutes to close. Then, in walked two couples. They were obviously friends. They had a coupon app on one of their phones, and we happily obliged them when they ordered to go. 

Then came the fateful question. ""How long can we stay before you bump us out?"" Well my dear lady, let me tell you. Our company has a policy that says that as managers we are not allowed to say anything that will make you leave the store before 10 pm, despite you paying less than just mine and my friend's salary with your order. 

So, being the good little manager, my friend spoke up telling them that the store premise was technically open to those already on it until 10. However, it had already been a slow night, and me and my friend both wanted to go home. We had previous to their entering the store done most of the work to get out of there. The drawers except for one were counted down, and the chairs were almost all put up. (So we can sweep and mop) We had maybe 15 minutes of work left, and that's a stretch.

Sure enough though, these couples took that dubiously unfriendly way of saying we have to allow them to stay until 10 as an invitation to stay. They took their seats at a table and opened their to go bags and started to dine, much to my dismay having just swept over there. 

I then looked at my friend, and he gave me the look. That look that means we have to get them out of here. He walked into the back, and flipped off 75-80% of the lights leaving only the hanging lights on. Enough to see and eat by, but not much more. I then proceeded to mop the whole floor, except for the tables around them. I then did two of the three tables near them, hoping to make them uncomfortable, but they were stalwart.

Finally in desperation I put up the chairs on the last table. I started to mop, and I watched as the only socially conscientious one of the group slumped in her seat. 

Now, having mopped the whole floor save near them, and more 12 minutes having passed us by walked over to the doors, where the rugs that I had rolled up to mop were. I took the largest one that came from the front entrance and unrolled it forcefully, in the air with a quick snap of my wrists, and a resounding whump sounded through the restaurant. However, this did nothing to make them aware of how close to being completely done we were.

Finally, I struck upon an idea, as I was unrolling those last rugs around the restaurant I called out to my friend, ""Hey Bob! I'm going to clock out now."" 

I then looked over at the group. Sure enough the one poor lady was now as low in her seat as she could get, and her food was in the to go bag, packed up and ready to go. However, the other three individuals seemed unperturbed by my actions.

I walked over to my friend resigned to our fate. I took a seat and began the wait for them to leave. After 15 minutes of waiting, I struck upon gold. I gestured to my friend to let me out one of the doors, but to lock it behind me.

When we approached the door, I gave him a high five and said, ""Have a good night man, hope you can get out of here soon."" in a not too quiet voice. It wasn't above normal talking volume, but the restaurant was quiet. It was at that point that the poor woman could take it no longer, she grabbed the food of the group, and put it into the take out bag, and walked out the door we had left unlocked for them.

The others followed, and we were able to finish closing only 30 minutes after when we should have all been home.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking from the title. That one weird family that stays two hours after close, after spending hours there before. But no, what I had was much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a manager at a smallish casual dining restaurant. I&amp;#39;ve been managing for 3ish months now, and I really like it. Today however, my best friend was the one managing the joint, and I was just closing the lobby. It was 9:02, and it was 3 minutes to close. Then, in walked two couples. They were obviously friends. They had a coupon app on one of their phones, and we happily obliged them when they ordered to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the fateful question. &amp;quot;How long can we stay before you bump us out?&amp;quot; Well my dear lady, let me tell you. Our company has a policy that says that as managers we are not allowed to say anything that will make you leave the store before 10 pm, despite you paying less than just mine and my friend&amp;#39;s salary with your order. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, being the good little manager, my friend spoke up telling them that the store premise was technically open to those already on it until 10.

It was a pretty popular place, especially in the mornings, and of course that’s when I was always scheduled. It was my first high paced job so I found myself a little stressed out at first, but I managed to get a hold of things sometimes. This day was not one of those times.

On this day, the day after a holiday, I was scheduled to work a morning shift, my usual shifts as no other host seemed to want to take them/to work in general apparently, and as per usual I was alone. This normally didn’t bother me, like I said it gets busy and sometimes I get stressed out but I usually manage.

On this particular day we had 5 servers scheduled, more than what we usually have on a Thursday, but one called in sick. We figured we wouldn’t really need her anyways, thinking it wouldn’t be too busy because everyone had the day before off and would be going back to work. But boy were we wrong. By say 10:30 we were completely slammed. Restaurant nearly full, servers having to be sat two or three times because people were coming in so fast, the kitchen was slightly understaffed so the food wait times started to go up a little. This kept up till going on 2:30, maybe 3.

Usually when it gets busy like that we start up a wait list and we tell the customers it may be a few minutes to be seated. On this day I REALLY needed to start that wait list because, due to how busy it had became, neither I nor the servers were having time to even clean off the tables. So I explained to the customers that it would be maybe 5-10 minutes to be seated due to the busyness and due to tables needing to be cleaned but I didn’t have the time to do them because of how many people were coming in the one time and due to so many people leaving at once and wanting to pay at the hostess stand (I was told that serving the customers comes before anything else so where so many people were coming in at once and so many people were trying to pay me the one time, I essentially couldn’t leave the hostess stand).

One woman comes in, the subject of this story, and asks for a table of 5. Now, we only had certain tables that could fit more than 4 people and all of them were currently taken. So I told this lady, I’ll call her C (for customer):

Me: “Well there’s currently a waitlist. There’s a few people ahead of you but they’ll all be seated shortly once a table is cleaned off, however it may be a bit longer of a wait for you since you have 5 people and all our tables for more than 4 are taken. It looks like one is about to become available, it just needs to be cleaned off. May I get your name for the waitlist?”

C: *gives me her name, how many is in her party, tells me if she needs a highchair, kids menus etc.*

She came in during the rush so I didn’t get a chance to go clean any tables, luckily it’s starting to clear off enough that the servers are able to clean their tables and I can seat some people.

After maybe 10-15 minutes, she comes up again.

C: “Excuse me.”

Me: “Yes?”

C: “How come there’s so many empty tables and you’re not seating anyone there?”

I’ve gotten this before and from the hostess stand a table can look clean but once you come upon it it’s actual dirty. So I kept my composure.

Me: “Well ma’am, the tables are empty but they’re still dirty. It got really busy and we weren’t prepared for it so the servers haven’t gotten time to clean them off, and I haven’t gotten a chance to step away from the hostess stand to clean them myself.”

C: “Can’t you just seat people there and tell them to wait 10 minutes?”

I was absolutely stunned. Did she really just ask me to seat people at DIRTY tables and tell them to WAIT UNTIL I COULD CLEAN THEM OFF EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE ALREADY SAT THERE?!

I just smiled and informed her that it’s against our policy to sit people at dirty tables, instead of asking her if she was fucking stupid.

The end of the story is pretty lame, we got through the waitlist within maybe 20 minutes as the place cleared out pretty quick and allowed us time to clean the tables and seat the people, WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT THEM AT DIRTY TABLES AND TELLING THEM TO WAIT. This is just one of many stories I could share about this place and I’ve been dying to find a subreddit to share them on since I started (I’m a part of r/Talesfromretail but I figured these stories don’t belong there) so if you guys don’t mind me posting more maybe I’ll share the rest of them.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I used to work as a host at a restaurant in my hometown.

I'm telling it anyways).  It was a long time ago back when I was in college but there are a few stories that have always stuck with me.

One was the Dude Who Ordered Horrifying Chili.

It was a slow night, one where I had polished the counter like a half dozen times already, one where I was actually praying for some customers to come in.  Not a rush, just a few here and there so I didn't get bored to death.  My prayers were answered.  But it must have been the devil that answered because hoo boy.

So in comes this customer, a guy maybe in his mid forties, he's ordering To Go.  I don't remember everything he ordered but I do remember the most important item.  A chili with cheese and sour cream.  I apologized, we didn't offer sour cream but told him he might be able to buy some at the market across the street is he really wanted it.  He looked disappointed but not overly upset.  I thought that would be the end of it.  I thought wrong.

He looks up and points to the side of me and asks 'Can I just have some of that on it instead?' I look over and seeing nothing that a sane person would want to put on chili (It was the station where we had the shake machine and the drive-thru soda fountain) expressed my confusion.  He pointed again and said 'That! That's the shake machine right? Just put a little of that on it.  It's basically the same thing.""  I laugh a little because I think he's joking and ask him if he wanted anything else on his order.

He was not joking.  He asked me if it would cost any extra.  I asked him if he was serious.  He was and told me again that the shake and sour cream was basically the same thing. I said to him 'No! Those things aren't even close to being the same thing at all! The shake is basically ice cream, sour cream isn't sweet at all.""

He would hear nothing of it.  I even offered to put a little in a condiment container so he could just try a little with it in case he hated it.  He insisted I put vanilla shake directly on his chili.  At this point I didn't even know if he really thought he was right or he thought he was too far into and couldn't back down without looking like a wimp or something.  I don't know.

So I rang him out, and made him his chili.  This memory is so distinct and disconcerting.  I remember going to the heater where we kept the chili and scooping it out and sprinkling the cheese on.  And then as if I was watching someone else from the third person walking all the way over to the other side of the counter where the shake machine was at.  I placed the chili cup where the empty drink cup should be.  A place a chili cup had no business being.  I pulled the lever down and watched a dollop of vanilla shake plop down onto the chili.  It was hot so the shake started melting almost instantly.  But it also cooled the top of the chili where the grease was which started to congeal a bit into this liquidy orange sludge.

I quickly covered it, bagged it, and handed it to the customer.  He thanked me and left.  I never saw him again.  I told my manager (who'd been on a smoke break) what happened.  He laughed and told me I probably killed a man that night.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my first real job way back when that wasn&amp;#39;t babysitting was at a popular fast food chain (does fast food count here?

this is mostly a rant about how shitty my manager was, highlighted by one really bad example 

a couple of years ago i was working as a server in a very busy cafe, like seven servers on the floor on the weekend. on the weekend it was popular with large groups, as we had the space to accomodate them. server assignments were back, front, outside, food runner, drink runner, door and floater. because of how busy it was, we all helped each other as much as possible and communication was VERY important. i was assigned to the back, meaning i was responsible for 10 three tops and two 12 tops/communal benches 

enter the manager from hell. micromanaging, short temper, controlling. she was the only one who was allowed to cash out customers (for a cafe that sat 150+), only her log in could mark tables as cleared. this would only be mildly annoying, except for the fact that she would often forget to do this, meaning we would find tables uncleared while we were trying to enter a new order, and would have to disrupt our flow to ask her whether it had been cleared

so this one saturday at about midday, were absolutely slammed. two of my 3 tops have been pushed together to create a 6 top. the meal goes fine, the family cashed out and leaves. the host tells me she’s sitting a new 6 top, i get them settled with water and menus, attend to other tables while they look. but once i get back to take their order (about 5 minutes) it’s been done. good old coworkers helping us out 

things are fine, they cash out and leave. 

15 minutes later a VERY angry man walks in. he has just paid for two 6 tops, and at a medium priced cafe, you’re looking at about 25USD a head. she sorts him out and then it was my turn 

i was about to get it 

never mind the fact that SHE didn’t clear the previous six top and SHE cashed out the second table for what was obviously way more than it should have been 

she spends 10 minutes chewing me out in front of customers, yelling at me for not asking her to clear the table, saying i should know better than to double up on a table in the system. by the end i am on verge of tears, but i maintain that i did not place the second order. she continues to berate me for my shitty work, until she decides to check the system for whose log in was used

did you guess it? it was hers. she fucked up at every step of the process, and proceeded to yell at me in front if customers, then dismissed me back to work without apologising or acknowledging that she was wrong. and we were so fucking slammed that i couldn’t take a minute to calm myself. the door girl and the floater had taken care of my section during my berating, but i had to get back into it 

she was the worst manager i’ve ever had and i have a bunch more similar stories

TL;DR - my manager fucks up and charges a guy for 12 covers, blames me for doubling the orders, it was entirely her fault and she wouldn’t even apologise for it 

i still want to spit in her food","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;on mobile, english is my first language, yadda yadda&lt;/p&gt;

1. The Toddler

A man came into the restaurant and walked up casually to the hostess stand. 

Man: I'm looking for a toddler 
Me: Pardon? 

I had been working for just over an hour and hadn't seen this man before, so I thought he had left a toddler there for over an hour. 

Man: A little girl, wearing a tutu. 

Now I had seen a little girl in a pastel tutu in the past 15 minutes. 

Me: Was anyone with her? 
Man: Of course, my wife. 

Thank GOD. I led the man to their table and told one of the waitress who laughed about it with me. 

2. A Wholesome Review

This is the second and final story. Last night, I was doing my finishing tasks of cleaning the hostess stand, and I was scrubbing the laminated paper we use (along with white board markers) to keep track of tables. 

Waitress A was talking to waitress B and the convo made me smile. 

A: I like the new hostess, CinnamonBaguette. She helps me clean my tables and she helps me with the plates. 

B: Yeah, I like her too. She's going to fit right in.

I started to realize that maybe I am one of those regulars :) There is one host that is usually a little grumpy, and he had the biggest smile when he saw me and came to chat. Just makes me think about the impact we have on people without even realizing, and how much I appreciate the regulars at my restaurant too.&lt;/p&gt;

As I’ve previously said, I work in a tiny cafe. six tables sitting two or three people. On a busy weekend we can have a waiting list of 4 or 5 tables. 

So this guy comes up to the door and says he’s waiting for a friend. I tell him that for a table of two he’s looking at a waiting time of 20-30 minutes and offer to put him on the waiting list.

He says that he’s going to wait until his friend arrives and see what they want to do. I tell him that that’s fine, but we do have a waiting list and he needs to be on it if he wants a table. He just smiles at me and goes outside to wait. 

About 45 minutes later, a very irate man trailed by a woman stalks up to my coworker and tells her that this is too long to wait for a table. She asks for his name so she can check where he is on the list, and when she can’t find him she calls me over. I explain what happened, and luckily my other coworker heard me at the start and was able to back me up. He left in a huff and went to sit st the cafe across the road, staring daggers at us. 

I offered to put him on the list twice, explained how it worked, and yet it’s somehow still my fault that he didn’t get sat. People will often as just arrive, see that we’re full and go to wait outside. If you don’t talk to us, we won’t know you’re there and if you’re name’s not on the waiting list then you won’t get sat.

a little explaination: I don‘t work at a restaurant as it‘s common but at an alpine hut, where people can stay overnight, have food and drinks and so on. we‘re basically an inn but way up in the mountains.

so at first, I was serving some dishes, two plates in one hand and salads and siverware in the other hand. I know, it‘s not the „proper“ technique, but I first grab one plate and then put the other one underneath it so it‘s supported by the first one. works perfectly fine for me. but sometimes when guests are especially hungry, they often want to grab a plate out of my hands. guess which one they‘d take. correctly, the top one. when I see them attempting to do so I usually day „don‘t you do that!“ with my strict voice and explain politlely and with ny friendly voice why they shouldn‘t grab anything out of my hands. today I got scolded by the „offender“ for being unfriendly. when I came to collect the empty plates, he said it hadn‘t tasted well. he had eaten everything. at least he didn‘t demand a refund.

since we are 6 people working here I usually serve drinks, take in orders for food and check people in. for the most time it‘s self service but in order to get the whole dinner ordeal done smoothly someone goes take in the orders at every table. since we have many guests today I told everyone that I‘d come around and that the wouldn‘t have to order their dinner at the bar. many people don‘t listen to me when I explain everything about the consumption card, their room &amp; bed and dinner, some ask everything straight after explained it to them, and today one guy convinced everyone near him that they‘d have to get up and order their food at the bar. I had to send everyone back individually. also, when I came to take their orders 15mins later, they didn‘t know what they wanted yet.

I live in Austria and most of our guests speak German. also I‘m fluent in English so that‘s no problem and I speak very little French, usually it‘s enough for the most basic communication and helps me to understand some Spanish or Italian words that can help. but every once in a while there are guests who don‘t speak even a little English, talk to me in their native language and expect me to understand them. today one guy shouted at me because I didn‘t understand him. when I looked at him cluelessly he just left, saying some stuff that sounded like swearing.

on top of all that I got scolded for chatting with our guests while getting their drinks ready. for some reason the kitchen staff think I‘m able to work and chat at the same time.

So it's a Friday night, we're pretty busy but we were closing in about an hour so things were starting to wind down. I'm wiping down a till when I see a girl (who happened to be black) try to fix her glasses with a drink in her hand and in doing so pours the drink entirely down her back. She didn't really seem to be aware of what she'd done so I flagged her in my head. 

About 10 mins later she comes up to the bar wanting shots and whiskey. I politely explain to her that she's had a bit too much to drink, that I can get her some water but she won't be served anymore alcohol. Cue to the bullshit to begin.

She immediately hits back with ""It's because I'm black isn't it?!"". Now, I'm really taken aback by this but I know what game she is playing and I have other customers to serve so I just walk away and go back about my life like nothing is wrong. This girl, very unhappy about being ignored, is now walking up and down the bar shouting and screaming about racist bartenders and how she's a victim here.

Since she's making a scene and she's pretty drunk, we called the Steward over to deal with her. Now where I work, we have the Stewards and we have Security. I'll let you guess which one is the nicer option to have called on you. So the Steward comes over and asks her to leave.

She punched the steward in the face.

So then we called over Security.

She punched Security in true ""you'll never take me alive"" fashion. Unlucky for her however, this Security guard is a mountain of a man and literally just lifted her up and carried her out. She walked down the street shouting some choice profanities but we thought that was the end of it. WE THOUGHT.

A little while after close, I'm wiping down the bar when a Police officer walks in. Apparently they've received reports that we're discriminating our customers based on race. This drunk bitch called the Police on US. So cut to us showing them the CCTV footage of her assaulting two people and they decide that the reports were probably falsified. 

Now the bar I work in probably won't feel any blow back from this because we're owned by a larger corporate entity and the bar does pretty well. But if she pulled this crap in an independent bar, they could lose some serious business over reports of racial discrimination. Pretty shitty of her to try to do but oh well, she's banned now so she can put that in her pipe and smoke it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been a bartender for a little under a year now and the other week dealt with the worst customer I&amp;#39;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

I just ate in a restaurant with the name of one of the world's most famous chefs here in the UK. The restaurant is in an event venue and when the bill came there was a 10% set gratuity added.

Now I can hear all you Americans telling me its not that much and why am I complaining. Well...

Firstly here in the UK tipping is pretty much optional as staff all get at least minimum wage which is £8:21 ph if you're over 25 which all the staff appeared to be. But I'm in the industry and I believe in tipping especially for good service. And she was lovely, I dithered about where to sit, changed my mind and made an alteration to the menu when I ordered.

So when my bill came and I saw the set gratuity added I asked ""do you get the gratuity?"" The response: well, not really. It goes to the venue and then 30% of it comes back to us and gets split between all the staff. So I'll see about 10pence. To our American friends that's like a tip of twelve cents.

So grrrrrrrr set gratuities! And I'm sure many people will look at their bills and see that and actively decide NOT to tip because they think that that will go to the wait staff.

A full on Absolute screaming fit. She's like 40 years old.

The manager ended up just swapping a late tables reservation so she could sit downstairs. It would've been fantastic if he'd told her to shove it, but he's retiring in a week so I guess just wanted to get it done.

This might be long idk I just got home from a split and just frustrated - feel free to skip my post :) 

So I want to start off by saying this is my first ‘real’ serving job and I’ve only worked here for about 9 months so I in no way have seniority but I think I’m a pretty good server. 

And I’ll mention a few things about our restaurant - it’s fairly big, we usually have 9 to sometimes 14 servers on at a time with 4ish table sections. we don’t have bussers or food runners- one expo, servers, 1-2 hosts and 1-2 bartenders and one manager on duty and kitchen of course. 

We just got a new manager recently who does all the scheduling now and is honestly trying to change everything about the restaurant. Here are a few 
-he’s refusing people to do lunch close splits which is the only time people make money on lunch shifts because you’re there for 8 hours but he refuses anyone to go into overtime 
-he wants people to work there 3 hours and LEAVE 
-he sucks at making the schedule. Fucks up everyone’s availability 
-planning on getting rid of split shifts entirely which again, is the only way people make money
-wants to hire more servers so we only every have a 3 table section MAX 

No one likes him- he is super unpredictable and has a really short temper. Ex: he scheduled someone a lunch close split and then GOT MAD at HER day of because she was working it. Like!!!!!! Whut!!!!

Also- we’ve been changing our sidework bc everyone is ungrateful brats who do half ass jobs at everything so they made extremely detailed lists about the sidework and split it up into smaller things but more people have to do side work- including splits which splits never used to do side work at night bc they’d do it at lunch so people are getting pissy about that too. 

Idk everyone is just ready to quit and we have an endless promotion going on until November and the kitchen hates us servers bc it’s hard for us to walk food bc we’re literally running around the restaurant sweating our asses off to make our tables happy so the expo is constantly yelling at us and bitching about us to the kitchen bc we aren’t walking food but it’s not like we’re standing around doing nothing????? We’re literally dying out there. Ugh I’m so stressed out and idk what to do.

Had a high maintenance table, table of 3, 2 of them ordered bevs and ate, so I figured they would be no problem. 

The 3rd person told me that her stomach was in turmoil, she may order something later. 
However, within minutes of smelling the fresh baked bread, her stomach magically felt better and then decided she was going all in for the bread &amp; pats of butter, that was brought for the paying customers. She then took it upon herself to ensure that “her friends”, had plenty of and continuously ordered bread and butter, “for her friends”. 

I asked her how her stomach was doing, to which she replied, with a bewildered look on her face, “huh?”  PRICELESS!!! 

I humored her requests of bread for “her friends”, til it got out of hand, and then just brought bread for the number of people at the table. She gave me a look but I gave her the “I dare ya to challenge me” look back. I counted.... she ate 13 pieces of bread. Her purse was too small to hide bread, her girdle was another story. 

I soon found out that they are regulars and they knew that I was a new server. 
About an hour later, after checking on them so many times, one could define it as stalking, I asked the table, about dessert and even recommended one, to which free bread lady said, “Oh no thank you”, but threw the, “we still have BIRTHDAY cake in the fridge from earlier”. 
Again... They’re regulars and knew the perks, as well as me being new, so they played, “Let’s test the new gal” game. 
I replied quickly, “Happy Birthday, I hope you have a great birthday”. 
“Free bread lady” (who doesn’t need any more bread in her diet) is still looking at me, says “What is the freebie?”, 

For what?” I respond. 

“For birthdays” she exclaims, getting all excited, drooling and foaming at the mouth simultaneously (is that even possible?) She wants to add, “you nitwit” but holds her mouth back, hoping for that free scrumptious dessert.

I looked at her, meeting her eyes so I could see the happiness drain, replacing itself with disappointment, and while staying very professional state; “Well, the policy is, as a rewards member and proof of birthday, we will be more than happy to help you celebrate with a dessert of your choice”. 

Suddenly, as her eyes drifted downward in a look of defeat, she quickly responded with, “Oh Harold, I left my ID in the car” Harold, who was stuffing his mouth full of buttery, warm, gooey goodness, looked up from his love making and had some confusion in his eyes, (5 bucks says he was going to ask, “whose birthday is it?” Lol). so I helped him by saying, “That’s okay”, and watch her eyes light back up, with thoughts of chocolaty diabetic goodness flowing through her veins, as I say, “I’m still on the clock for an hour, so I can wait.” and add, “this is going to be so much fun, it will be my first birthday celebration”.

&lt;p&gt;I looked at her, meeting her eyes so I could see the happiness drain, replacing itself with disappointment, and while staying very professional state; “Well, the policy is, as a rewards member and proof of birthday, we will be more than happy to help you celebrate with a dessert of your choice”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, as her eyes drifted downward in a look of defeat, she quickly responded with, “Oh Harold, I left my ID in the car” Harold, who was stuffing his mouth full of buttery, warm, gooey goodness, looked up from his love making and had some confusion in his eyes, (5 bucks says he was going to ask, “whose birthday is it?” Lol). so I helped him by saying, “That’s okay”, and watch her eyes light back up, with thoughts of chocolaty diabetic goodness flowing through her veins, as I say, “I’m still on the clock for an hour, so I can wait.” and add, “this is going to be so much fun, it will be my first birthday celebration”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, we saved a rogue dessert tonight, yet the breadsticks were a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

First, let me start by saying I’ve never done this. I work at a chain restaurant where i routinely make 10% on my sales for the night. I’m used to shitty tips, but we’re busy enough where I almost always “make my nut”. 

It’s a Sunday shift which are notorious for the shitty customers it attracts. For whatever reason, it’s one of our busiest days but also a low earning shift. So a family of 4 come in. Mom, dad, ~24 y.o. Male and his younger brother. Right away I know I’ve served them before. I’m good with recalling familiar faces, but horrible with remembering if they were good or bad tippers. 

Boys got our upcharged drinks, parents 2 drinks from the bar, and our most expensive app. Good start. Then they start to order. The parents didn’t speak English well so the orders flowed through their older son. The two boys got the $33 ribeye, and both parents got our $28 surf/turf combo, 4 of our most expensive plates.

Older brother(O.B.) is CRUSHING drinks. Probably refilled 5/6 times. I was cut so most of my tables were gone so I really focused on them bc the tab was up to $160. Food comes, mom’s steak was well done enough (this should say a lot). No problem, throw it back on the grill and comes back how she likes it.

Drop the bill and older brother reaches for his wallet. Then it all starts flooding back. I remember they did the same thing last time; pricey plates, hella refills, kid paid and left a shitty tip. Couldn’t remember how shitty tho so I wait and see. 

I return the bill and they scurry out like the rats they are. A common trait I’ve noticed of bad tippers is when you hit them with the “thanks guys have a good night” they rarely say it back and actively avoid eye contact. The shame is too much for them to bare. 

So I go grab the boo....THIS MOTHERFUCKER! HE SIGNED HIS NAME AND NOTHING ELSE!
(This was my cover if I got shit from manager. We need atleast a total on the receipt + signature)

Fuck it. I didn’t even think, just followed them out the door and they had already reached the car across the lot.

ME: “MY MAN!”

O.B. *Snapped around with a shocked/concerned look* “hey what’s up?”

ME: “you need to fill out ALL fields of the receipt, not just sign you name.”

I then walk the dumbass through it.

ME: “if you were satisfied with you’re experience you write the tip *HERE*, then write the total *HERE*”

O.B.: “oh my bad”
He grabs the pen, writes down $20 tip, but doesn’t add it to total and still writes $160. He then pulls and $20 out of his wallet and hands it to me.

O.B.:”sorry about that”

ME: “uh huh.”

And I return to my comrades, triumphantly beaming with success. I could have taken the $20 on the card plus the cash, but decided to show mercy. 

Him immediately writing in the tip told me a lot. Some people that don’t tip legitimately don’t know better. But most ppl know they’re fucking over the server who took care of them, but are cheap skates anyways. This guy, when confronted with the face of his injustice(me), immediately folded and did what he should have done in the 1st place; leave a damn tip!

Living behind the restaurant is a vet. He comes in around 5 days a week, drinks from around noon to 5-6 pm.  Some days he orders food to go.
He can be frustrating to work around, because he is loud and belligerent and I try hard to seat customers away from his talking radius, but he has been kicked out of a lot of places, and the boss likes that he spends money there, so we get the privilege of listening to his stories every day. 
Normally, I greatly respect the vets (I am one), but he also doesn’t listen *at all* if you try to interact or interject. He just overtalks us.

My frustration happened last weekend as I have a full bar and him. The drunker he gets, the more demanding and belligerent he gets. Last weekend was particularly bad because he’d been there a long time, left, and come back for more. He sent me (on individual occasions and not as a single request) downstairs for a t-shirt (twice)...to the chef for gift certificates (twice), for a new food order, for a burger for his dog...it just kept going. 

I was fit to be tied. I had other customers but he just wanted me to keep running for HIM. He even gets mad if we focus on other customers and let him drink in silence for a while, He quits angrily (saying he won’t come back), leaves some insult change on the counter, and stumbles out. 

I usually pray this might keep him away for two whole days. But as he is kicked out of most places....no, it doesn’t.

I tend to work a lot of day shifts which include a wonderfully cheap happy hour and the slow ""good"" hours on the draw lottery which pull in a full rail of retirees most days from about 2-5.
Yesterday 3 of my favorites were at the bar and during a conversation about the seemingly randomness of life one of the guys, Roy, ended up getting on the topic of how he met his wife while she was in cosmetology school and he was her instructor. I was shocked as I wouldnt have expected this former electrical lineman to have also mastered styling hair, let alone well enough to teach it to others. He said he still colors her hair but he doesn't cut it because of a botched experience once lol. 

After this conversation I had to share a story of an awful haircut I'd had, the guy wouldn't cut my bangs because he was afraid to cut curly bangs, then he used a bristle brush on my wet curls ruining them (which I explained to the bald old men was a no no), and to finish he also did not blow dry my hair as their high end salon 'didn't have a diffuser' so I walked out with sopping wet hair. All three of these 80 year old men started raising a big old ruckus about my hair, saying ""You paid for that?!"" And ""He used a what brush on your hair?!"" Old Joe who almost never talks even piped up to say, ""And I bet you still tipped him too! For what! Rat hair?!"" 

It got me thinking after they left about why they'd care or pretend to care about something that obviously doesn't matter in the least to them. Then it dawned on me that when Roy talks about the deal he got on bulk meats by driving 45 minutes to the Amish market I enthusiastically listen and ask about where this market is and what he's using that meat for. Or when Bob went from flip phone to smart phone I spent a good three hours teaching him how to use the basics and especially how to save grandkid pics. Old Harry has given me over $2000 in huge jars of loose change as my tip over the past year to help with my student loans, Stu fixed my jeep's air conditioning twice when it took a poop and would only accept beer as payment, and Larry made me a personalized monogrammed lei in his print shop as a send off when I went to Kauai for a month. When Lenny and Linda went out of town I stopped by their house every day after work to water the plants and feed and love the cat. One of my closest friends is a 65 year old woman named Jen I met at the bar, I help trim the MJ she and her son grow (legal state) and babysit her little goats and big dogs when she goes out of town. I spend hours at her house with my pup just sitting on the deck and listening to her talk about life. 

I realized these folks have become so much more than regulars, they've become my friends or like a bunch of surrogate grandparents and in turn they treat me like some beer equipped granddaughter. I care about their lives and they care about mine. After graduating college, all of my own friends save 2 live at least a 2 hour drive away. I don't see them like I used to and it's been strange being a total loner. It's like somehow these folks knew that and decided to just treat me like a peer and integrate me into their small town bar regular group. They invite me to barbecues and events all the time, though I usually have to work on those nights of course, and are genuinely disappointed when I can't make the event. Its sweet and makes me feel appreciated in a very cool way. 

I wanted to post this as a reminder that behind every customer is a deep and intricately built individual. We are in the business of service but that doesnt mean we can't make genuine connections at the job.

This my first post on r/TalesFromYourServer. I hope you like it.

I work at a small volunteer-run cafe and bookstore in my city. I work cashier and we get pretty busy during lunch being right by a bunch of schools as well as we are right on a major road.

The way this place works is that you order and we'll give a table number. We'll bring you your food and your drinks but if you want a refill you have to come up and ask for one.

We also have water jugs and cups out so if someone wants water it's free and easy to access.


It was a particularly busy day so I was running around and answering the phone as well as helping customers at the till.

We finally have a lull when this old lady who was sitting comes over to the counter where the water jugs are. She glared at me.

OL: Old Lady
Me: Me
AM: Awesome Manager

OL: So I guess you don't do table service! ((She's saying this rudely btw))

Me: I'm sorry we don't do table service.

OL: Well I've been waving at you for the past 5 minutes!!

Me: I'm very sorry. We got pretty busy and I'm the only one on the floor today. Would you like a jug to bring to your table so you don't have to get up again?

OL: *snaps at me* I don't need anymore water! *storms off*

I am feel bad thinking how I should have been more aware of if she was waving at me. My AM brought me into the kitchen to tell me how it wasn't my fault and that I handled the situation as best as I could have.

OL continued to glare at me for the rest of her visit while we got pretty busy again. I still feel bad even though this happened yesterday.

I'm sure I could remember many more stories but some years have passed, and the alcohol and other substances through the years have fuzzied some of the memories.

Anyways, my last gig was at a cozy little neighborhood wine bar. We served really phenomenal food and had a killer boutique wine selection, but were completely unpretentious and approachable about all of it. Even had a little TV behind the bar showing sports or old movies or whatever. 

This day happened to be Opening Day of the baseball season, and I, being a huge baseball fan had a game on the TV. It was mid-afternoon so there was maybe a table or two in the dining section, a regular and another older woman seated separately at the bar. I was being chatty and friendly with the regular and casually paying attention to the baseball on TV when the other woman at the bar caught my eye. 

""Excuse me sir, but I see you're very interested in this baseball game""

""Why yes ma'am, I'm a huge fan of the sport""

""Can I ask you what might be a stupid question""

Me, putting on the ol' bartender charm ""Ma'am there is no such thing as a stupid question, only a stupid answer""

""Is this the World Series?""

I laughed pretty heartily and explained how the whole baseball season worked to her and that today was just the first of 162 games until the World Series which is months from now in October. She also laughed and said ""I knew it was a stupid question!""

Then her, myself, and the other lady regular chatted for the next hour or so all about baseball and how their fathers both loved the game so much. It was a fun way to pass the time until we got busy.

My job is to wash dishes, clean the dining area and outside eating area, do inventory counts, log temperatures of fridge and freezer, get new deliveries, clean the kitchen, pull the garbages, etc.

When the trash in the kitchen, dining area, and outside courtyards get full, I pull them and take them into the trash room. In the trash room, there is a big trash cart where we put all the trash bags in. Towards the end of my shift, the garbage people go in the trash room and grab the cart and they take it outside to the trash compacter and they grab a fresh, empty trash cart to bring into the trash room.

One garbage man in particular has been complaining that the trash cart in the trash room is very stuffed and that it is overflowing. Now, it is the garbage people's job to take the cart outside to the compacter. I can do it if I want, but it is technically their job.

This garbage man has been bitching and complaining to us people who work in the cafe about how the trash cart is overstuffed. Since I handle most of the trash, he has been trying to use me to assist him. He showed me how to get to the compacter and everything since I have only been there once and didn't really remember how to get there. He guided me and I got a new trash cart and then brought it back the first time he complained.

He complained again today about the cart being overstuffed, and once again I helped him, but this time he basically had me do all the work.

I told my manager about this and he said, ""Why doesn't he just have one of his partners empty it once early in the day, and once again later in the day so it won't be so stuffed?"" And also when the garbage man came in to grab me, he asked me, ""What time do you get off?"" He asked me so he could see if I had time to help him.

I told him, ""I am supposed to be off at 4:30, but I can help you a little bit."" It was like 4:40, but I've been staying overtime because we are short staffed right now. One of my coworkers said, ""Dang he asking you what time you get off. That is none of his business."" And also as I was helping him, he was a little hostile. When one of the trash bags was on the floor he told me, ""Put that crap in there!""

I get a bad vibe from this man, and he doesn't seem like a very nice person. I feel like I am being taken advantage of and a little disrespected. I don't want to get even with him because I do not want to be involved in an altercation.

When I got done assisting him today, one of my coworkers asked me, ""DCT, did he guide you or help you, or did he have you do everything?"" I lied and said that he did help me, because I did not want to be looked at as a fool.

My manager told me that he has been corresponding to the person who manages the trash people, and he has been telling him what's going on. He told me that it looks like that garbage man is going to be in trouble. My manager told me, ""Don't worry.""

I feel bad because I do not want my coworkers or anyone to think I am a pushover or that I am weak. Being more assertive and standing up for myself is something I need to work on. However, if I stood up for myself and told the trash man I am not going to help you or when he asked me what time I get off and if I would've told him, ""That's none of your business"", that could've lead to a dispute and I was trying to avoid that.

This man is also a lot older than me. He is about 50 and I am 22.

I hope he gets fired because I do not want this chaos to continue and I do not want to continue to see this toxic man.

What do you guys think?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in a hospital cafe as a Utility/Stock person. The cafe is a new facility. It&amp;#39;s only been open for a month and a half. I&amp;#39;ve been working there now for 14 days. My job is to wash dishes, clean the dining area and outside eating area, do inventory counts, log temperatures of fridge and freezer, get new deliveries, clean the kitchen, pull the garbages, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the trash in the kitchen, dining area, and outside courtyards get full, I pull them and take them into the trash room. In the trash room, there is a big trash cart where we put all the trash bags in. Towards the end of my shift, the garbage people go in the trash room and grab the cart and they take it outside to the trash compacter and they grab a fresh, empty trash cart to bring into the trash room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One garbage man in particular has been complaining that the trash cart in the trash room is very stuffed and that it is overflowing. Now, it is the garbage people&amp;#39;s job to take the cart outside to the compacter. I can do it if I want, but it is technically their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This garbage man has been bitching and complaining to us people who work in the cafe about how the trash cart is overstuffed.

It really is. 
I got a call on a Saturday at 6:21 that the opener (6am) had called out and could I come in as soon as possible. 
I had prearranged a sitter so I said ok got in the shower and got there in 30 minutes. Before I left that day I asked my boss if he needed me to open the next day because the opener is NOT known for her reliability. 
He said yes, I said ok and I came in to open the next day-a Sunday. Our busiest day. I figured it was better to go to bed early than get the call at 6am. 
So my sitter picked my kiddo up from my uncle at 7am and brought her up to see me; as two days in a row I had left before she woke up. 
It is rare for my sitter to do that, she knows I’m usually alone that early but my daughter is super convincing and cute so she brought her up for breakfast. 

When they first got there I only had one other table, but within 15 minutes or so I had 4 more so I was limited in my interaction with my kiddo and sitter. My daughter was being REALLY good, like A plus sweet and kind behavior and she knew I was busy being a “waitross” so she didn’t yell or try to call me over. 

The table behind my kiddo and sitter was a super pleasant couple that was an easy order. We all laughed when I gave my kiddo a hug and they asked if I gave all of my tables hugs. I said no only tables with my relatives. At that point all my tables were laughing and it was just a good morning.

Soon after my sitter left to take my kiddo on a Sunday adventure. The man from the table behind them caught me at the register and asked if serving was the only job I had, I said yes that it was the only job I’ve found in 5 years that allows me to be a parent and work without having to work multiple jobs. I said it was just me and my daughter(I never use the phrase single mom to my customers- I think that phrase is used incorrectly and solo mom people don’t understand)  and that it was important I could spend as much time with her as I could. 

I went about my business and thought nothing of it. At this point it’s about 7:45am- I wasn’t meant to be in that morning until 8am. (I worked 6am-5pm that day I almost died 😂) 

I go back to the kind couples table for the final time and there is a $50 bill sitting on it. He had called my manager over and basically said-I’m paraphrasing- that he loved how I interacted with my kiddo, how sweet she was, how well behaved she was while I was working and that even before he found out it was just me and her he wanted to give me some extra. He said that he wanted me to use the money to do something we wouldn’t normally be able to do. 
I of course cried like a baby at his table, blubbered thank you and went to the back to cry. 

The perfect storm of events allowed this entire interaction to happen starting with my least favorite coworker calling out and me being the goody two shoes that covered. 

And for reference I’m in the Midwest and $50 (on an $18 tab) is a LOT of money. $50 in general is a lot of money to us, I stretch our dimes into dollars but it’s still pretty lean over here. 

I made more money that day than I ever have there, and was able to take my kiddo on a super fun adventure the next day AND I could even buy the t-shirts. I never can afford the t-shirts. 

If I had money I would do shit like that all the time,

So I work in a take-away restaurant in a rural Australian town that is owned and run by my parents. Last night, a mum and her son (who looked about 5-6 years old) came in and made a small order. These two are known to me, as every time they come in, her son takes every single colouring-in, as well as pencils from the 'kids table, (table near the front windows that has some toys like Connect 4 and a Magic 8 ball, as well as the aforementioned colouring-ins and pencils). Up until this point, we had not done anything about it, except for taking the colouring-ins away when we see them coming, and putting them back when they leave. Well tonight, I decided that enough was enough. 

The mum didn't have enough money to pay for the order, so she asks if her son is ok to stay in the store while she's goes to get some money from an ATM up the road. The shop was empty, so I said sure. As she was leaving, she told him to not take anything from the kids table. Sure enough, as soon as she leaves, he starts taking all of the colouring-ins from the table, and puts them in his bag. So I very bravely decided that enough was enough. I folded my arms, and gave him my best disapproving/angry glare from the counter. He saw me doing this, and proceeded to put all of the stolen goods back on the table. He sat down at the table, head resting on his hands, and waited for me to turn around, or to go into the kitchen or something like that, so he could keep stealing the precious colouring-ins and pencils. But I wasn't going anywhere anytime soon. This staring contest went for almost 5 minutes, until his mum came back, and paid for the meals. I checked the table after they left, and all of the colouring-ins were still there.

But I figured I’d share some experiences from a less than stellar serving job I had a few summers back.

A little Greek restaurant in my hometown is the setting. Famous for hot dogs, but also had some nicer dishes like gyros and shrimp. So generally, the food was pretty cheap and decent. Tips were not nearly as bad as you’d think. The place was absolutely booming.

One issue here was that we were paid state minimum wage. $7.25 where I am. We then split the tips, but were maxed out at $11 total (so $7.25 + $3.75 tip) Typically we had on average 4 tables an hour, with an average tip of $5 each. 

Not only did the owner get to pocket many tips, but we were also required to carry our tips from the table (with it always visible) straight to the tip jar. Just a weird feeling. 

Managers would be on constant watch of the cameras and announce on the intercom if you needed to check on a table, when often times that table was very well taken care of and sick of hearing, “are we doing okay over here?” 

There were no breaks, unless you ousted yourself as a smoker. In this case, you had 5 minutes exactly to smoke. This meant you asked permission to have the break, once the clock was on an exact number you’d walk out and begin the break. If you were more than 5 minutes you lost break privileges. 

One time I was seriously hungry and nearing the end of my 10 hour shift and we were slammed. So I couldn’t even use the break to sneak some food. I kept a chicken tender in my pocket and hid in places where the camera couldn’t see me to sneak a bite here and there.

The worst part was that phones were locked in the managers office all day. I get not texting at work completely, but it was very strange not being able to communicate for 10 hours of a day. Just like the twilight zone.

I should add that this place of work is pretty comical in my town for always having a “now hiring” sign out front.

I work at a seasonal outdoor seafood restaurant. We have a large patio/deck area overlooking water and boats. I understand that some people live inland and do not regularly experience boats and water. 

However- sometimes people sit outside when it is not ideal. It’s raining, or it’s windy or it’s humid and way too hot. I know they can’t be comfortable yet they stay outside. Is it just me or is outdoor dining a little overrated?

My co workers and I often wonder if other servers that work outside experience the same type of guests we do. For example: 

Host: Hey how many are you going to be? 
Customer: OUTSIDE

Or

Host: hey how are you? Inside or outside today?
Customer (after just coming inside from being outside) “how is it outside? Is it cold”

Or sometimes they totally bypass the host because they are running to grab an outside table. They’ll order salads in a wind storm and half the lettuce will fly off the plate as we’re bringing it out to them. We don’t have any cover from the restaurant to the deck so we use umbrellas to make sure their food stays dry. At that point isn’t it just ridiculous to be sitting out there?

Perhaps I’m too cynical. Do any servers on here relate to this?

Disclaimer: Please don't judge my mother too harshly. She has a fiery passion for the people she loves and a quick temper. It can sometimes lead to a reactionary form of justice. 

Our restaurant worked with a local program that hired mentally disabled employees. It was a great program that helped people live independent lives and be a part of the workforce. We had hired a lady named Wilma through the program. She was a lady in her 50's that we all LOVED. We hired her as a dishwasher and she was the best dishwasher we had ever had. She loved her job and worked harder than any other employee we had. Wilma was always assisted by a lady named Joyce. Everyone hired through the program came with an assistant. Assistants were there to make sure the people hired were ok in their jobs, monitor their mental and physical health, make sure they were being treated fairly and not being taken advantage of, ect. 

Wilma was a beast when it came to work. She generally loved doing anything an everything she could do. So most of Joyce's (and the rest of the crew) job was just keeping an eye on Wilma and making sure she took breaks, wasn't getting overheated, drinking water, eating and taking a moment to interact with everyone because if you didn't watch her she'd work her self to death.  Joyce was a saint and really cared about her job and cared about Wilma.

One week Joyce wasn't able to come in with Wilma so the company sent a substitute with her and she was awful. She was a young girl in her 20's and you could just tell she had no interest in being there or in her job. Which is fine and all if your job isn't responsible for the health and safety of someone else. Several times my mother and other crew members had to tell this girl she needed to watch Wilma and do her job. She wasn't letting Wilma take breaks, making her go drink water or eat. This girl wasn't helping out when Wilma was in the weeds or regulating how much of a workload she was taking on. She just sat in the corner playing on her phone while this poor woman worked herself to death. Every time my mother or staff would remind her about her job to take care of Wilma it was met with attitude. She would always respond with something like ""I aint work for you!"" or ""mind ya own business"" 

On the second day things got worse. We were slammed busy and it was a hot day. We were all busting ass and of course dishes were piling up. The waitstaff was taking any bit of time they could to help wash some and make Wilma take breaks but as the day got on it just got worse.

At this point I had to leave mid shift to go drop off/set up a catering. By the time I got back lunch rush was over and all that was left was back of house clean up. My mother, our cook and Wilma and her substitute assistant were all that was left.

I pull up get out of the catering van. My mother and the cook are sitting outside on the patio and I can immediately tell something is off. They are both frazzled and my mom's hair is mussed. I ask what the hell happened. 

Cook: \*takes a long drag off of his cigarette\* ""your mother...""

Mom: "" I had it. It was the last straw. I just had too. I had to beat her. I just had too"" 

Me ""Beat? Beat who?!"" 

Mom: ""That stupid bitch. I caught her being mean to Wilma. I warned her. I told her if I caught her again"" 

Me: ""oh...okaaay"" 

Mom: ""so now we are just waiting for the cops to come pick me up"" 

Apparently what happened is my mother came around the corner to see the substitute yelling at Wilma to stop slowing down and ""get this shit done so I can get outta here"".  She found Wilma was damn near heat exhaustion and was being denied water and breaks. This girl had been sitting on a stool in the corner watching Wilma nearly pass out while she texted her BF.  When my mother told Wilma to get out of the 90 degree dish pit sit down and get some water the girl grabbed her arm and jerked her back pointed at the sink and said ""nuh-uh you aint leavin till this shit get done! I already been here too long. I got somewhere to be!"" And then my mother saw red...

The cook said he just heard yelling and cussing and came running in to find my mom on top of the girl going at her like a wild animal. He couldn't get her to stop so he being all of 6'3"" ex army pinned my moms arms to her side (she continued to kick) and picked up the 5'3"" hellion and walked outside with her like a toddler having a fit. The girl got up ran out screaming she was going to call the cops and a bunch of other choice words.  

Wilma apparently was unfazed and didn't see much of the fight because she had just done as she was told and went to take a much needed break during that time. She didn't over heat and she had been picked up by her guardian before I got back.

Cops were never called/came. Wilma's guardian filed a complaint about the abusive assistant in our place. Business continued as normal the next week when Joyce came back and it was never spoke of again.


EDIT: for anyone debating the legality of what my mother did. She'd be the first to admit that she'd have a pretty weak case (thus why she was waiting for the cops) Afterwards she did feel bad for her actions and realized that she reacted without thinking it through. As for the aid I think she wanted to avoid the possible charges brought against her as much as my mom did. And in the end from what we could tell though it looked savage the only real injury to either party was hurt pride....remember the woman is only 5'3""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the popularity of my last post and the overwhelming love that y&amp;#39;all had for my crazy mother I am going to share more of our crazy adventures in restaurant land.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, I wasn't open yet.

So, I told them what movie they came to see, some of their drinks, and highlights of their banal conversation. ""Well, that sounds right but you must have mixed us up with someone else because we're great tippers. We would NEVER stiff a bartender and we you've never even served us before."" Okay, sure.

I realise part of the problem is it was designed to be table service while offering great spaces for the kind of groups who want pay-as-you-go bar service (extended family groups, wakes, sports round-ups etc.) 

The bistro bar is not equipped to handle loads of people going up to get drinks and order food at once. It's less than ten meters long and about a meter wide; two people have to pass each other side-on. It was designed for the bartender to make up drinks orders that come through the receipt machine, not from customers going up to the bar. The bistro's official policy is that all table service orders take priority (so a receipt that just came in takes priority over the person who's been standing there for ten minutes) but it's not always feasible to do it that way. 

Some groups, particularly the abovementioned ones, insist on bar service. We explain how quickly that will slow things down for everyone, and that we can do split billing if the issue is wanting to only pay for what your ordered. Nope, they want bar service. On the most recent example, a fourteen-family group insisted they wanted bar service. I asked them, if they insisted, to at least give a name at the bar to put on the docket, so we could say 'Sarah at table ten' rather than have all the people at table ten who ordered a bowl of chips trying to work out whose it is. Oh, and to order any drinks that were being ordered without food at the main bar, which is actually set up for bar service, and bring them through, if the bistro bar was looking swamped. I even explained that you would get your drink far quicker this way. 

Naturally, no-one ever gave a name or went to main bar. And naturally, they got upset when we had no way of distinguishing whose order was whose BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUALS ORDERED DIDN'T GIVE US A NAME. (And yes, I'm aware that the poor guy manning the till should have asked for a name, so that's on both him and the people involved.)  If we have a dozen orders of chicken nuggets spread over 6 dockets, all for table 10, we have no idea which food belongs to whose kids. And naturally, they got upset about having to wait at the teeny tiny bar while the bartender dared to make up drinks for the table orders. 

I can kind of see it from the customer's perspective. We aren't equipped for bar service and I wish the venue or bistro manager would say that when these people make bookings. Failing that, I wish the customers would take my advice when I make suggestions like giving names and getting drinks from main bar.

I work at a cute little cafè in a small town. We do not serve your food to your table. You pay at the registrer and bring it with you (it's mostly baked goods, cake and coffee, not anything heated). This is normal for these kinda cafès in my country. It's basically a small town version of a Starbucks with more focus on food and less on coffee.

Our customers are maybe 60% elders, 30% children families and 10% ""others"" who usually just passed through and decided to make a pit stop. 
Naturally, having elders as our primary customer base, we tend to observe them to see if they're actually able to carry their tray comfortably. If they're not, we make exceptions and serve them at their table.

At the particular time this story took place, we had only one elder lady in our shop and otherwise young adults. Particularly one young lady that sat alone. The elder lady was the perfect example of our table serving exception. If she were to carry her coffee cup to her table, there wouldn't be coffee left in it by the time she sat down, so I took it and she was very grateful.

5 minutes pass and the young lady comes over to complain. She starts going on about why I served her to her table, but not herself. I calmly explained that we do not have table serving, but we make obvious exceptions and we're happy to do whatever we can help if we're asked. I also apologized for not offering to do it for her (although she picked her stuff up and brought it to her table with no issue before I'd even be able to offer it).

Apparently this wasn't okay what so ever. She started yelling at me about how we need to change our policy to serving everyone or NO ONE. So fuck that old lady who just wanted a coffee and a slice of cake without being stopped by her age, right?

I just kept saying that we aim to make everyone happy and accomedate as much as we possibly can to each individual customer and eventually offered her a free refill for her cappuccino that I'd bring to her table, but she declined and stomped out of there mumbling about how elders don't deserve special treatment.

Edit: Oh wow, I had no idea this would blow up so much! Thank you for kind words, everyone! And I gotta say, I agree with a lot of you.

If she were to carry her coffee cup to her table, there wouldn&amp;#39;t be coffee left in it by the time she sat down, so I took it and she was very grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 minutes pass and the young lady comes over to complain. She starts going on about why I served her to her table, but not herself. I calmly explained that we do not have table serving, but we make obvious exceptions and we&amp;#39;re happy to do whatever we can help if we&amp;#39;re asked. I also apologized for not offering to do it for her (although she picked her stuff up and brought it to her table with no issue before I&amp;#39;d even be able to offer it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently this wasn&amp;#39;t okay what so ever. She started yelling at me about how we need to change our policy to serving everyone or NO ONE. So fuck that old lady who just wanted a coffee and a slice of cake without being stopped by her age, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just kept saying that we aim to make everyone happy and accomedate as much as we possibly can to each individual customer and eventually offered her a free refill for her cappuccino that I&amp;#39;d bring to her table, but she declined and stomped out of there mumbling about how elders don&amp;#39;t deserve special treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Oh wow, I had no idea this would blow up so much! Thank you for kind words, everyone! And I gotta say, I agree with a lot of you. I just really hope she learns to let go of this entitled attitude before she becomes a full blown Karen.&lt;/p&gt;

During studying I've worked/been working in the restaurant industry for about 5 years, mostly summers, in a Northern European country where tipping is done only if the service and food has been exeptional.

I found this subreddit and just find it bizarre. I know that in some countries like America (where most of Reddit's people come from) wages are basically nonexistant and waiters survive on tipping. 

Still, so many stories here are just downright hostile. Like there was a restaurant full of people and a person was busting their ass and one table didn't give them 15% tip and now they're crying in the corner because it's sad. If that is very unusual, don't you have all the rest of the restaurant full of tipping people? I feel like I maybe just don't get it?

I started working at like 10$/h, now with ""seniority"" about 13$. Tipping means that I get about 12$ more every two weeks. If your wages come only from tipping and there's like only 4 tables per hour for a normal day, don't you get a lot more money than I do? I remember one story where some waiter was so happy about a big table that had racked in about a 200$ bill, because they would get like at least 25% tip? That sounds like an insane amount of tip money. If that's the normal way of doing things, don't you actually get a really nice wage?

~Let's say you were in an interview for a server/bartender position at a small spot (seats at most 50-60ppl). 

You are informed that the restaurant does tip pool (front of house puts all the tips for the entire day in one pot to be split by hours worked). 

You are also told that the tip-out is 5.5% on TOTAL sales including drinks and TAX. Support is limited to one person (Thurs to Sunday) that deals with delivery and helps with hosting. 

Would you take a job, or would you bail the minute you learned of the tip pool &amp; tip-out policies?~

I've been here just over a year and our staff turnover is abysmal. As in I'm in a constant state of hiring and training. People rarely stay more than 4 months, some dont even finish training to be honest. 

I've tried to discuss with the owner that the tip policy is a  major factor to the turnover. That the only comparable tip out situation I've experienced was in fine dining. Where we had multiple managers on the floor,  hostesses, food runners, bussers, a barback. He absolutely refused to even consider it. He then went on a long rant, most of it nothing to do with the reason for the tip policy.

It's a big city with hundreds of restaurants, most of which have a tip out around 1% to kitchen, 1% to bar, and 1% to support (if there are any). And there is certainly no tipping out on taxes. 

It's definitely disheartening to see huge portions of your hard earned money go to lazy servers and to a tip-out that has no explanation. 

Many nights the tip-out has more money in it than any server walks out with.

I already hated the job for the unfair hours and cuts along with the lack of air conditioning and such a dirty environment that OSHA would have a field day shutting down that location. However, this is one of those stories where the customer happened to be worse than my actual job.

I was two weeks into my job, yet I was still in the rookie sections. I had a three-table section. Along with being triple-sat, I eventually was sat during a rush a group of four men. The older gentleman were kind, but the son was the epitome of ""I never was put on time out"". He critiqued my every move as well as made it so I had to cater to him more so than the other tables I had. As I finally get their orders, I asked, ""So, is everyone ready to order?"" Sadly, this was THAT table where they nod confidently and then open up their order with ""UHHHHHHHH hold on..."" 

With the entitled son, I had to navigate through the menu to find him the perfect meal. In order to upsell (we risked our jobs if we could not upsell), I recommended our most expensive dish. It wasn't even just for the upsell, but because it genuinely was the most edible dish we had. I let him know the price ($20) and he obliged. Since I have worked my way up in the food industry, I've picked up on certain etiquette to control in order to prevent or to be able to handle ""Karen"" situations. I learned it doesn't work when you're a faceless servant to a corporation. 

I repeated each and every order back to the men. They all nodded in agreement that I have recited their correct order. Just to be clear, the entitled guy confirmed he would be ordering our most expensive item. I ring up their food, their food is delivered, they eat, and I check up on them. Towards the end, I got their tickets sorted and split. When I handed it to them, I walked to my other tables, but I was eventually stopped by the EM (I'm tired of saying Entitled Man). He started hounding me and spouting in my face as to why his bill was so expensive. 

Me: ""I showed you the item you wanted on the menu and you said you wanted it.""

EM: ""No, I wanted the Create Your Own! I made this pasta!""

Me: ""The Create Your Own pasta is on a different page, I clearly indicated that you would be ordering \_\_\_\_\_.""

EM: ""No, I pointed to this! I said I wanted this and you charged me for this!"" 

Me: ""I confirmed that you wanted \_\_\_\_ before I rung in your orders. You also ate all of your food.""

My manager made me apologize and said, ""You may be right, but he is complaining. The customer is always right,"" type of spiel. 

I got back to the table to find the three, mature men clearly uncomfortable with the son's actions. EM had a smug look and I knew that he knew what he was doing.

So I'm working the lounge in my casual tex-mex restaurant. It's open seating, and we have table payment ziosks.

Midway through my shift today two ladies come in and order a margarita and a cocktail. No problem... they both order one of our amazing deals where you get a drink, a starter and an entree for a pretty damn good price.

They honestly take forever sitting in one of our few booths in my 12-table section, but I'm really not busy so I'm okay with it... They're just chatting having a good time, seemingly taking a bite every 2-3 minutes. I know the type and they're pretty low maintenance honestly...

Well they finally finish, so like a good corporate little slave, I ask them to use the table payment system so my corporation can collect info on them and sell it to advertisers or whatever the hell they do.

I see them paying using the ziosk, and sliding the tip either up or down, I kinda looked away... but everything seems to be going fine with their payment, I go into the kitchen to tray some food.

After running the food, I go to the table and see a business card propped up on their margarita glass for some kind of ""Generational Wealth Management"" that includes crypto trading or something. I snag it and go to check what tip they left me... because if anything is a signal of not being tipped it's that!

They frickin split the bill, only paid for their drinks, and just up and left... and left me their bullshit generational wealth management business card. I didn't even check the tip because I was honestly just shocked they had the balls to do a walk out and leave their business card.

Debating whether to call the number but I don't want spam calls every day, lmao!

&lt;p&gt;Idiot: No! I want lettuce,Tomato,BBQ sauce and all that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: What else would you like beside that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idiot:Bacon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Ok and are Fries ok as a side&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idiot: uhhh no what else can I have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes on for a total of around 10 minutes(it&amp;#39;s also busy as hell) then two minutes after he gets his food he sends the mixed vegetables back because he didn&amp;#39;t know cauliflower was a mixed vegetable.... So he wants mashed potatoes instead. I comply and drop off his mashed potatoes. Five minutes later he gets my attention again and asks &amp;quot;Man can I just get fries instead of this?&amp;quot; This is when I&amp;#39;m about to lose my shit when his sister interjects and says &amp;quot;Here I don&amp;#39;t want my fries take mine.&amp;quot; I wanted to make this families day better but this dude really needs to get a grip on how things work. It&amp;#39;s amazing he&amp;#39;s survived as long as he has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL/DR: Really stupid guy doesn&amp;#39;t understand anything I say and makes his order take almost ten minutes to order a burger. Then hates every side that he substitutes for fries and accepts fries in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

It was an independent restaurant in a large mall downtown, so you would get a pretty mixed bag of clients. 

I have been in the industry a fair amount of time at this point in my food and beverage employment... and I have seen it all. When drama or problems would go down, I was the server they would send in to soothe rude or unsatisfied guest because I have a natural nack of dealing with people. 

This one day, my manager comes up and says he has two guests who sent an essay of an email of the awful service they received the previous visit, from one of our staff. The manager explained it was one of our weaker, semi-permanently stoned servers and it wasn't a surprise to either of us that this was the case. He asked me to serve and ""wow"" them. I happily agreed.

The two sat down and I read the situation as I greeted them. They were two awesome and sassy transitioning women - right up my alley. Right off the get-go, they tell me they had the worst experience with the previous server and only came back on the request of our management team to give the restaurant a second chance. I gave a chuckle and told them, ""Oh. Well. You're going to absolutely have a better time this time."" Giving me a bit of sass, they demanded to know how that would be possible. I laughed again playfully replying, ""well obviously it's because I'M your server!"" They loved this an started laughing like crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

They started off drinking some damn dirty, vodka martinis - my kinda crowd! Before I knew it, they had each downed 3. They were laughing and having a great time. I suggested ordering some food. Since they had consumed a fair bit of alcohol so quickly, I didn't want things to get messy.... but ohhhhh did they get messy.

Their order of calamari came up and each popped a couple of bites in, nodding in satisfaction. *Cool! They're good!*, I thought, as I moved along to deal with other tables. When I glanced back, I saw them attempting to toss calamari into the shirts of my male coworkers ... coworkers who were located on the other side of the restaurant... the FULL restaurant... My manager (a different one - the ASSHOLE one) started mouthing angrily at me to get it under control. Now very uncomfortable, and them now on their 4th martini, I laugh in the most genuine way I can muster that they're being naughty and kindly and sweetly suggest they shouldn't throw the food about pretending to confide that my other manager is an asshole who's going to give me shit because of it. They laugh, say, ""Fuck him."" Tell me I'm the best, and they would never want to get me in trouble.

They chilled out... for a few minutes. 

They finish their calamari and seemed to have simmered down. They ask for another martini each... I'm getting a little nervous, but don't want to get in shit for not giving them awesome service, so I oblige and get them another round. Moments after digging into their martinis, they begin calling over my male coworkers and shoving 20$ bills down their V neck shirts. Although I will say I am very against people touching other people without their consent, especially in a sexual manner, it was pretty funny to see straight males getting uncomfortable from the unwanted sexual advances of my two ladies (you know - the thing most of us women have to deal with constantly). A lot of my male coworkers kept handing the money back and running away (all except one... and good for him lol!)

That was the last straw... I had to cut them off. After a whole bottle of premium vodka being polished off and their app, their bill sat at 220$. And they were pissed at being cut off... they understood, but I began worrying that they may not tip because they were angry and that I was going to have to tip a lot out of my own pocket for them.

One of the ladies gestured for me to come over after I had placed the bill on the table and given them a few moments. I came over nervously, seeing a pile of bills stacked on the cheque. ""Sit down,"" she commanded at me. I looked around nervously explaining that we aren't allowed to sit down, let alone with guests. Her voice got firmer and she demanded I sit. I, again, explained I couldn't. She then stated, ""do you want a tip? If you don't sit down, I won't give you one."" I make eye contact with my manager (the non-ASSHOLE) and give an awkward and cringy look as I sit down beside her.

""I want you to count out the bills for me as I hand them to you,"" she stated as she took my hand and opened it so that my palm was facing upward. ""Count,"" she said as she started placing them on my palm. ""20.."" I apprehensively started counting, ""40... 60... 80... (insert more counting by 20's here)... 180... 200... 220... 240,"" I internally breathed a sign of relief at least knowing I wasn't going to be losing any money on this table.. and I kept counting. ""260... 280... 300.."" I started slowing down in my counting... I was now at a 80$ tip... she couldn't be fucking serious?! 

""Why are you slowing down?!"" she demanded. 

I was stunned! ""You're giving me WAYYY too much!""

She looked at me completely disgusted and said, ""I get to decide how much I give you! And here is some advice... if someone is giving you cash, you shut up and take it! Now! Keep counting!"" 

By the time I was finished, I sat with 645$ in my hand, my jaw to the ground and my head wheeling!! 

She grabbed my face, yelled, ""YOU WERE AMAZING!"" and then proceeded to stick her tongue down my throat. She hopped up, her friend following right behind, grabbed their purses, an ice cube out of their glasses, whipped it at my asshole manager and proceeded to glide out the iron doors of the restaurant while I sat completely dumbfounded, 425$ richer.

And that was the time I pretty much made a 200% tip on a fucking Wednesday AFTERNOON!

One day a man in his late 20's/early 30's comes in and orders a steak and a beer. I try (ever so slightly) to start a friendly chat but it's clear he just wants to be left alone, so I do just that.

He asks for his bill which comes to $24.90, hands me $25, and says keep the change (with much attitude). I ask him if he's sure and tell him I expect that dime to go a lot further in his pocket than it will in mine. Clearly he needs it more. He walks away as I'm still chirping him.
    
The next day he enters and only orders a pop this time. I'm more the ""kill em with kindness"" type so I was especially jovial and made sure to give him exemplary service. Again, no tip, but I care much less because 3% of $3 is less than 10 cents and I was having a good day anyway. 
    
His final visit came the very next day. Orders the same steak and beer combo as day 1. I give great service. Bill time, he hands me a $50. I break it and return his change. He proceeds to pocket it all. I'm like, ""seriously dude? Were you unhappy with your service?""
    
He says no, it was great. Why do you think I keep coming back here?
I say if it's so great than why don't you tip me? I proceed to explain that I tip out the kitchen so essentially am paying to serve him and the asshole has the audacity to say, ""well I gave you that dime the other day"".

A place where my literal server nightmare came true. I started at Fruitbeez as a host and worked myself into server and expo. So I knew the place pretty well and was fairly good at my job. Until the day from hell. I was pulling a double and working straight through because eighteen yr old me was money hungry honey. The other closer had a doctor's appt and her relief had a flat tire but management ok'd me taking over her tables. Instead of letting me know where they were in terms of service she straight dipped out. Fuck up number one. I'm rolling with 2 sections and about five tables in each. My relief (who was just gonna be an additional server had been doing management training that day and was given an extra hour on her break. Fuck up number 2. As the evening host comes on the mod is at a table with the health inspector, bartender gets a 20 top togo order, and people are lining up at the door. The host seats every single person and I end up with almost twenty tables in four sections.

We survived and at the end of my shift when the write up was produced I refused to sign, told him and the gm to suck a fat one, and after almost two years I walked out and never looked back.

A place where my literal server nightmare came true. I started at Fruitbeez as a host and worked myself into server and expo. So I knew the place pretty well and was fairly good at my job. Until the day from hell. I was pulling a double and working straight through because eighteen yr old me was money hungry honey. The other closer had a doctor&amp;#39;s appt and her relief had a flat tire but management ok&amp;#39;d me taking over her tables. Instead of letting me know where they were in terms of service she straight dipped out. Fuck up number one. I&amp;#39;m rolling with 2 sections and about five tables in each. My relief (who was just gonna be an additional server had been doing management training that day and was given an extra hour on her break. Fuck up number 2. As the evening host comes on the mod is at a table with the health inspector, bartender gets a 20 top togo order, and people are lining up at the door. The host seats every single person and I end up with almost twenty tables in four sections. At some point after it descended into complete chaos I interrupt the manager and just say hey I need help here. He was pissed. At me. We survived and at the end of my shift when the write up was produced I refused to sign, told him and the gm to suck a fat one, and after almost two years I walked out and never looked back. I&amp;#39;ll never forget how it felt the first time realizing not all managers are management material and in the corporate world they definitely see you as replaceable no matter how good of a job you&amp;#39;ve done in the past. No more chains for me. Also John, if you&amp;#39;re out there, you&amp;#39;re a turd and your wife was banging the head cook. You&amp;#39;re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

Oh wait yeah I do, my store is cutting corners in literally every way possible to save on any bills. I work corporate. If they undercut their expenses by enough, the managers get bonuses. 
It was insanely hot in the store tonight, even customers were complaining while just sitting down to enjoy their meal. Not to mention myself and my fellow servers literally dripping sweat because we’re running around.

I also had a couple and their child tonight move into my section just as I had already been double sat. As they saw me walking by they said “haha we moved!” As if that would make it okay. But I was busy. I should have sent them back to the host but hindsight is 20-20. I ignored them and took care of the tables I was initially sat but when I got caught up and got to them, I WANTED to be an ass, but I couldn’t. They had a small child with them.

The woman asked me if all of our sides were included. Yes, they are. But I didn’t mention some are a dollar ninety nine more expensive because it’s ON THE FUCKING MENU. 
So, come checkout time, just as I’m about to get sat a 7 top that another server didn’t want because they come in every week and tip like shit and let their stupid kids run all around the restaurant (I’ve literally almost dropped hot food on these kids because they pop out of nowhere from under tables) the woman is complaining about TWO DOLLARS THAT I ALREADY SAVED HER. Because she asked if it was included and I said yes and didn’t reiterate that it was a tiny bit more money. We went back and forth for a minute and I flat out told her I answered the question she asked me and if she wanted me to go get a menu I’d gladly fucking read it to her. (I didn’t use any swear words but my stance at that point was pretty apparent that I wasn’t giving her anything off her bill.)

idk how to get people to realize that i'm not their server, I know it doesn't take long to explain that I'm not a server but it's just a big pet peeve of mine.

I work at an expensive, ""casual fine dining"" restaurant in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles and, as I am trying to lift myself out of debt, I am working the maximum hours a week that I can and... I've just had it.

I could go into detail about the specific situations that happened this week at my place of work, but basically I have felt completely unsupported. I've stayed at this job because I love the people I work with so much, but the kitchen is a mess, management is a mess  (1 manager is great, others are completely absent), and the guests have been particularly awful. We are pushing seating so much and trying to flip because the restaurant is broke and is trying not to fold. 

Long story short, I take it all so personally. When a guest is rude, when a guest is disappointed (and rightfully so), when Chef yells at me to make himself feel better, I take all of these feelings home with me. I've been so depleted, all I want to do when I get home is drink and eat and not be productive at all. I consistently vent to my boyfriend, god bless him, and I usually end of crying just thinking about the service. 

A little back story: I am an actor, this is not my passion, but I have been working as a server for 10 years.

I tell my manager there's mold on the tomato. He furiously took the tomato off and angrily sent me back out. I told him that's not going to cut it and to remake the burger.

I told the customer their food was being remade and the customer asked for a free drink despite not drinking anything before. That felt unwarranted to me as their food was being remade. Plus, I wasn't going to bother my manager considering the situation in the BOH.

Shortly thereafter, my manager ran up to me with the remake but it had the wrong side. I told the customer to just enjoy the other side for free and then a runner brought out the correct side.

(I’m going to already apologize for unnecessary commas.)

I work in a movie theatre bar, I’m a bartender there. It’s my first restaurant job, been there since the place opened, but I’ve learned the ropes quickly, know all the drinks, and I especially know the laws when it comes to serving alcohol.

So, we will set the scene. A guy with what looks like his 9 year old son comes in and is eyeing out draft selection, I immediately ask if he would like a beer, he says yes. I kindly ask for his ID and wouldn’t you know it, it’s expired by three months. I explain that I can’t accept it because it’s expired. 
He’s visibly annoyed saying 
“I’m obviously forty”

I just reiterate that I can’t help him with the beer, but would be happy to get him anything else.
He immediately gets his phone out to make a call, smugly, and put a finger up to tell me to stop talking.
I don’t think anything of it and help my other customers. After they are settled I ask if he needs anything else, he says no but that I’ll be “hearing from his friend” to verify his age. I kind of laugh and say I can only accept physical forms of identification.

(Cut to me going to my managers to give them a heads up that I might need them because this guy is being weird. I felt stupid going to the office for such a small thing, but not after what happened!)
He goes to his movie with his son, I don’t think much of it. 

Then I see BOTH of my managers come out from the office asking me to get them some beer and they start pouring it themselves. I joke asking if we can drink on the job now? Then it hits me. HIM.

They are both pissed.

But not at me.

Apparently this rich asshole is friends with one of our owners and called above FOUR LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT just to get a beer.

My managers were so mad that this guy did this because it puts everyone in jeopardy, me, my supervisors, even my GM.

I asked if this guy was really that important and bless my managers heart they were so mad, they said “not enough for this bullshit”.

He also named dropped me because one our other owners called about the situation and said “Them? They’re the nice bartender, why does he have a problem with them?” 

Anyways he got his stupid beer that my amazing managers had to hand deliver to him because he thought he deserved them even though we could lose our jobs.
They are apparently going to discuss his behavior at the next owner’s meeting because believe it or not, this isn’t the first time he’s done this.

I am just so mad that this asshole thinks so little of my team, basically my work family, that he would be willing to jeopardize a lot of people’s jobs just for a beer. What hurts most of all is that he did that in front of a kid. 
I’m 21 and just signed a lease on a new apartment, 
I’m not going to lose my license, job, and pay an extreme fine just to give a guy a beer.

I went to our town's most popular Chinese restaurant the other day. I have always just done delivery with them and tipped nicely (one time during a very bad rain storm I tipped the delivery guy $20, he was shocked,I was just happy I didn't have to go pick up with 3 little kids)!

So I go in - grab a menu &amp; started circling my order, poor woman on the phone had her cell &amp; business phones taking orders to go.  She couldn't even get a second to breathe, it was crazy!

She got a minute - took my order sheet to the kitchen, and literally 5 minutes later she brought my order out.  I was shocked again.  Gave her my card to pay - wrote a $5 tip in the tip section, she saw me and said ""OH NO, you don't have to do that!""  I said ""YES, I want to - I would never be able to do what you do""! 
There is a service charge of a $1 + change for take out but I doubt that goes to her.

Despite the challenges I've never once cried, I've always been good at dealing with most people and problem solving. It takes a lot for me to cry. Okay so I work graveyard for 8 hours every weekend, it's usually only me at night in the restaurant with the Chef, and the dishwasher. That's it. Literally. Sometimes only me and the chef. However sometimes it gets so busy and I'm running around everywhere as so many people come at the same time sometimes. Sometimes I am even full house alone. . . I have to seat people, Cash them out/take payments, take phone calls. I'm always extremely overwhelmed however the managers do not care and I think they take advantage of the fact that I am also only 18 and they make me do the night shift, and yes I do plan to quit as I can't do this anymore. It's way too much. I feel like I've done a good job for the experience I have and I leave with quite a bit of money every time. (The only pro)

Tonight I literally almost cried while on my shift. I thought I could do it but....I don't think I can. Being the only female server overnight I get a lot of annoying harassment from drunk men, Tonight I had a table who were a complete nightmare. Not only was I already managing like half the restaurant all by myself they were extremely rude and hostile towards me. I was taking a bit of time (Which was like only like 6 minutes) serving them their drinks because I had to make all of them myself and I had food I had to serve first to others.

This one guy (he was a grown ass man btw, probably 30 or some shit.) he starts getting up and yelling at me saying he wants his milkshakes, etc, and he was just being so rude even after I told them I would be right there. I honestly wanted to kick them out but I was the only server and I was too scared to tell them to leave.. I was afraid they would hurt me. I then punched all their orders in and they eventually got all their food but they also got up from their table and went to HARASS THE CHEF. They told him his cooking is sh\*t, etc, and being extremely rude. I was just scared at this point and I don't know how I managed to not cry. I wanted to quit right then and there.

They actually left me a 15% tip which I was surprised of.

The asshole who was being rude actually apologized in the end (like wtf..) ""This is too much for a 18 year old to handle, I am sorry for being an asshole but you were great"" LIKE LOL funny how ur saying that but u were the only one being difficult to me. I would've been okay if not for you.

Since I did not know how to handle this situation alone, after my shift ended and I left I just started crying.

Also Yeah... I told my managers and they think its no big deal and that I wasn't busy at all. Like yeah right, you try doing everything by yourselves but of course you guys won't do it. Thanks.

Short recap for those who didn't read the original. Scheduled for a party of 135 with just me, and a new server. No auto grat at my place. I have day job, and have been working the restaurant until they hire to recover from a mass quitting due to clueless owner and GM.

Went in a little early to try and talk some sense into owner and GM. I asked for another server, or at least to be allowed to auto grat. Shot down on both.

Party starts to arrive, I introduce myself and newbie to lady in charge. She asks where the other servers for her party are, I explain we are it.  She is pissed. I tell her I already voiced concerns, she will have to take it up with GM. 

They trickled in pretty slowly, we did a pretty fair job with drink orders. I had preset some dressings to try and make the salads go easier, and preset extra napkins, bread, etc. It went as well as it could go, but it was rough. New server was completely overwhelmed, head lady was rude, and they were not the most understanding party.

It ended up being 1 check, ( thank the restaurant gods). The total was just shy of $5000.00. She left $60.00 total tip. New server is crying in the kitchen, and the vein in my forehead is popping out. $60.00 doesn't even cover the bar tip out, let alone the bus or host tip out.

Heated discussion between myself and the owner ensues, and it is clear she doesn't care I'm at negative money for the night, actually the week now. I tell her that I will not be returning. She switches gears, tries to ""reason"" with me. I give the new server the 60 bucks, tell the owner I will be calling the labor control board if I don't get paid minimum wage for the week. I tell her and the GM both how I feel about them (fucking incompetent douchebags), and out the door I go with both middle fingers in the air. Feels good.

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Whomever gave me gold, thank you So much for the tip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you for the second gold! Also, thank you for the support. Be excellent to each other!&lt;/p&gt;

3d... and theme park advertises said bee saving garden....
3e. Also the place is covered in ""BEEWARE OF BEES"" signs

6. Bees are hot too and they like sugar. Dont want to attack bees? Avoid cold sweet things. 

7. Stop running and flailing around like youre on fire. The bee is much less dangerous to you then you are to it.

It's about an event last night and some people commented saying that it should be a post of it's own, so here we are. Enjoy

I had one group of 50 who had made a reservation with no preference to what area they were in, one group of 25 who also didn't mind and one group of 30 that told me when making the reservation that he wanted to be ""on the left side when you are on the terrace facing the building, because that's a quiet corner"". I told him that he made a reservation for a Friday night at 20:00, there would be no quiet corner and also the spot he picked was near the bathrooms, so that particular spot would see a lot of extra traffic, but he still wanted it there. Fine. This was all over the phone

So yesterday night rolled by and the 25 and 50 arrived at the same timish. Showed them their spots and they were happy. Then about an hour later this asscake wobbles in and says, wihtout any context:

""There are people in my area""

""Good evening sir, I'm fine, thanks and how are you? What can I do for you tonight?""

""There are PEOPLE in MY area""

""I think we're in a disagreement of what is who's then sir. See, all of this is actually MY area ;) But maybe if you explain your issue a with a bit more context, we can figure something out!""

""I made a reservation and there are people in my area""

""Ah, good! You must be Bob, then! I think we spoke on the phone! You wanted the left side as seen from the terrace?""

""Yes, there are people there""

""Well yes and no, sir! You are pointing at the right side, you specifically told me you wanted to be on the left side, near the toilets. But you're 30 minutes early, which is not a problem, all the people in this area know that it's been reserved at 20:00. You're welcome to have a drink and wait till the people are gone and your reservation starts, though!""

""I want to be on the left side!""

""Yes sir, this is the left side. See; LEFT \*point left\* and RIGHT \*point right\*""

We had now walked outside so I could show them man his area. He looks at it and says

""No, THAT is the left side""

""Uhm, no sir. That's the right side. But that side has been reserved by another group, so you can't go there, even if it WERE the left side, but it's the right side.""

""Yes but I RESERVED the LEFT side""

""...which is over here, sir"" once again pointing at the left side.

I told him to wait for the people to clear out and that the whole left side would be his. He still didn't seem to agree but at this point I had lost any patience and really couldn't change the set up anyway, so I walked away hoping this asscake would just shut the fuck up.

I go back outside at around 19:50 to make a round on the terrace and see how everyone is, I find the man talking to the host of the group of 50 and I hear him say ""...I reserved this area at 20:00, so you need to go""

and I instinctively wanted to punch the dude in the face. What the fuck does he think he is doing, trying to claim an area he did not reserve and tell 50 of my guest they need to go? Get the fuck out of here you entitled piece of shit babyboomer, what the fuck.

I walk up to the pair, the host of the group clearly confused and laughingly tell him ""I am so sorry sir, in all his years Bob here hasn't been able to learn where left and right is, haha! He's reserved the area on the LEFT side of the terrace, which is now actually empty and ready for him. Actually, some of his guests are already here. There is absolutely no need for you to leave or move, and even IF this were the case, I don't think Bob here needs to worry about doing my job now, does he?"" and I literally dragged him back to his area.

You think it would stop here, but no.

About half an hour later I make another round and I start in the area with the group of 50. I see these folded up coasters that say ""Reserved - Bob"" on them. What the actual flying herpes fuckery is this?! Goddamit Bob, you're a suborn piece of shit aren't you? I ask the dude who's hosting his birthday here and he says Bob has been putting these on tables as soon as they were empty. I told him not to worry and took them all away and walked over to Bob. I had to literally tell him that no, it is not OK to reserve tables in someone's area and that NO, he can not do it again and NO I do not want him to mess with my night any further. He didn't seem to understand so I told him that if he would do anything other than just enjoying his night in THE AREA HE RESERVED, I would be forced to kick him and his 30 guests out. He ended up behaving like a good boy eventually.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In relation to &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/d0nwzh/cant_you_just_kick_them_out_no_sir_i_cannot/ezfcuho/?context=3""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, I commented my story below.

Hello once again fellow Servers &amp; other visiting Redditors, welcome to #2. Sorry it's been a bit later than I'd expected. Life got in the way of Reddit...

TLDR at the bottom.

On the day of this particular story, we were closing up the entire lower riverside dining area, as it had been reserved in it's entirety for an office party - it was for \~70 people, 30 current employees &amp; their +1 guest, and about 10 former significant employees or other guests of honour. There was the rope cordon across the stairs and a big ""Reserved"" sign so people couldn't enter without passing them.  

The owner and organiser of the party was Larry. Larry and his wife, Laura, were simply the greatest customers you could hope for. They both owned their own small businesses when they met and our all-you-can-eat was their first dinner date location. They'd been together for years, and turned up roughly every fortnight since. Always came for Valentines day (and we made extra sure their date was amazing!). Every Christmas they'd bring several tubs of the sweets (Quality Street, Roses, Cadbury's etc) for the staff. If it was super-quiet, they'd ask the staff to pull up a chair, chat to them, pay for your drinks. You get the picture - they're perfection incarnate as customers. 

Larry's business exploded in popularity, and Laura's grew steadily too. So, to celebrate their big financial milestone (Breaking £1M in yearly revenue), he'd reserved the entire lower dining room and was footing the bill for their entire party - with a caveat that bottles of wine (+ similar) ordered couldn't be more than £20, which was fine, most were less than that anyway. 

Now, the reservation was for 4:30pm, and we'd just had a busy late-lunch service. As such, I volunteered to look after the upper street-level dining area by myself, to free up the rest of the front-of-house (FOH) staff to set up the lower dining area. Cleaning all the tables, folding fancy serviettes, setting up the cutlery &amp; glasses etc. Making it look especially nice for them. 

Enter Sharon and her meek boyfriend at 4pm. I greet them, and ask whether they'd like a street-side window or one of the aisle. Nope, Sharon wants to sit riverside. I explain that, unfortunately for them, the entire riverside dining area is reserved so they can't sit there. Sharon does not like this, tries the old ""Oh, surely you can squeeze us two in there, we don't take up much space"". No. It's upper dining only. Eventually, she relents and takes the aisle table closest to the stairs. I fetch their drinks, tell them to help themselves to the food and enjoy the evening. I go to deal with other customers, thinking the minor ordeal dealt with. Sadly, it was not to be.

About 5 minutes later, one of the other FOH members of staff calls me over, looking slightly peeved. They tell me I should've given them a bit of warning that some of the party guests had arrived. My response was that none had arrived yet, so I was a bit lost. FOH takes me to our viewpoint and lo and behold - Sharon and her boyfriend sitting riverside, with plates of food on a 4-top. Not just any riverside table either, right in the centre which (in my opinion) was the best table for views. I say I'll deal with it. Go down, 'remind' them that lower is fully reserved and they need to move. Sharon was adamant she wasn't moving now she'd gotten her food and that 'no-one will mind just the two of us'. Brief argument resolves nothing and since I can't physically remove them, have to relent and let them sit and go back to upper.

Enter Larry and about 20 guests. I welcome them, then ask to have a quick word with Larry. I explain the situation, apologise profoundly. He just laughs it off, says not to worry. I swear I notice a mischievous flicker in his eyes. Within a further 10 minutes or so, most of the rest of the party has arrived. Now, as I was upper the rest of the story I got second hand from the Larry &amp; the FOH who remained downstairs. (Obviously, I could hear snippets but missed the drama). 

So, Larry, sitting at the head of one of the tables. Motions for silence, makes his short speech thanking his employees for their work, how he's proud of their achievement etc. He ends with ""Eat, Drink, and BE MERRY, for Monday it's back to work!"" in his booming voice, to a round of applause, cheers and false groans. They were having a bit drink and mingling before sitting down to eat properly about 5pm. Some grabbed small plates of finger food to walk around with too.

All of this around Sharon in the middle. Boyfriend was evidently mortified but Sharon was unphased. Larry had planned something special for them though. He'd pulled aside a few employees to join in too...

One employee sat at down on Sharon's 4-top; ""Hi, I'm Jill from HR, what department are you guys?"". To which, Sharon had to admit she didn't work for them. ""Oh..., sorry about that, thought we'd booked the entire floor"" then walked away. Repeat twice more with ""Janice from Accounting"" and ""Big Dave, Warehouse Supervisor"". It was very obvious Sharon didn't belong, so they were clearly just messing with her, and it wasn't impressing her.

Then, the big man himself, Larry sits down with them. ""Hi guys, Larry - Owner. Don't recognise you guys, which department are you from?"". Once again, Sharon admits she doesn't work for them. ""Oh, terribly sorry - I thought I'd booked the entire lower floor. Actually, I'm sure I passed a big reserved sign on the stairs. There was a cordon as well wasn't there...?"". Sharon admits she ignored them because she wanted to sit riverside. ""Oh, well, that's alright then. We'll just work round you, imagine we're not here. I'll tell the others not to bother you.""

Larry stands up, and in his booming voice calls for silence. ""Hey everyone, this is..."" (Points at Sharon &amp; BF for their names) ""... Sharon and Mike. They don't work for me, they just *ignored the reserved signs* because they wanted the riverside table. I know it's a bit difficult as they're *sitting in the middle of the room*, but try not to disturb them too much. Cheers guys, as you were"". Cue some quiet laughter, looking over shoulders and snide comments. 

Apparently, the BF looked like he was considering jumping through our window into the river to get out of the situation. By this point, even Sharon had had enough. A few minutes later, she &amp; BF slipped back upstairs to leave. Wanted us to give them their meal for free ""because the fat \[barstool\] had public humiliated her and we shouldn't have allowed it."". Told her I'd said it was reserved and she ignored it. Then she tried to get the food at the cheaper lunchtime prices \[only half-service buffet\], as she didn't eat as much as she'd like. Sorry, till won't let me do that, even though it totally would. Free drinks? Afraid not, against policy to provide free drinks even though it wasn't. Eventually, she storms off leaving BF to pay. He quietly apologises, then scurries after her. 

Rest of the evening was fairly uneventful, though they did keep us open late drinking into the wee hours of the morning. Which was fine, they'd asked and said to chuck them out whenever we wanted to close up. But the amount they drank more than paid for the few staff who stayed on. All in all, party was a huge success, and Larry freely admitted he'd enjoyed messing with them because ""A'hole customers deserve to be f\*\*\*ed with"".

TLDR: Customers ignore signs reserving area for large party. Large party enters and has some fun at the expense of rude customers. Rude customers demand discounts and get nothing but the full bill.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For restaurant &amp;amp; my background - go read Tales from the Orient #1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I am scheduled to work a party. I hate large groups. We don&amp;#39;t auto grat., and we allow separate checks. Typically we aren&amp;#39;t allowed to take parties of more than 14 without splitting them. Tonight, however, I get the pleasure of splitting a party of 135 with a brand new server. I can&amp;#39;t even begin to fathom how this is going to be fine, in fact I&amp;#39;m pretty sure this is going to be all of my server nightmares come to life. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure if I even go in, I&amp;#39;m going to snap at some point and quit. I have a day job. I&amp;#39;m just there because I feel bad they are short staffed (it&amp;#39;s thier own fault). I just can&amp;#39;t even. Not my circus, not my monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;

So the new owners are from a nearby major city and made it sound like they were going to make it more upscale than it is.

This is where it starts to fall apart folks. I always thought myself as a person without standards when it came to a job honestly, but seems I do in fact have a line. They took down all the nice needlework chinese ""paintings"" (my old boss had bought them from some chinese art store that had gone out of business) and the new owner started putting up the most ridiculous artwork in it's place. It was like 3D Paintings, like those bookmarks you get where if you move your head the picture moves but like huge. They're all super corny too, like wolves and dolphins and crap. I thought to myself, eh could be worse a lot of chinese restaurants have silly pictures like this (heck my old boss had one of those moving light up waterfall paintings).

However a line was crossed today into the surreal. In the main entranceway the first thing that people see when they come thru the doors. They put up a big 3D painting of The Last Supper.

MY BRAIN BROKE DOWN ON THE SPOT BECAUSE IT CAUGHT ME SO OFF GUARD.

I thought ""did one of the regular customers pull a prank?"" but then I realized why would the customers have 3D painting of Jesus. who in their right mind would have such a painting? Then I realized yes, the new owners were actually considering putting this painting as the first thing people see when entering the restaurant.

She leaves, and I go to take the trash out (big mistake) and she is on the sidewalk telling her tiny daughter that I closed early, and she wasn't going to get ice cream.

A few years ago, I was working at a small bakery/coffee shop. This was the kind of place that you would stop in to buy a loaf of bread, pastry, or a quick sandwich. Sometimes we would have some cupcakes, but definitely not the kind of place that did whole cakes. Also, we were a small crew and would start our day early in the morning and therefore close early in the evening.


So one evening, it was about 7:30 and I was closing by myself. Our hours were from 6am-5pm and so I was almost done with all of my closing duties so I was excited to get out of there and get home. All the lights were off and the drawers were counted and in the safe and I was in the middle of mopping the floor when I heard a knock at the door. Now this was fairly common as we had these huge garage style windows so customers could see that we were still inside and would always ignore the closed sign and try and open the bolted door. Usually I would just mouth, ""sorry, closed"" and point to the door, but this woman would not give up, and kept pounding at the door. Annoyed, I put down my mop to go talk to her. me= me EL= entitled lady


Me: I'm sorry ma'am, we're closed right now


EL: Oh come on! I need a cake for a party I'm going to.


Me: Oh sorry to hear that, we don't have any cakes, and also we are closed. Best of luck!


EL: *grabs the door to stop me from shutting it*
You don't have cakes?! But you're a bakery? What kind of bakery doesn't have cakes? Let me just buy something! I need something for this party, I need to be there in 15 min!


Me: I'm sorry but I can't do that, even if I had any pastries large enough to share at a big party, I wouldn't be able to sell it to you, my drawer is closed, the POS is off and the money is deposited. You'll have to check out the ""Nameofbakeryjustdownthestreet"" and see if they have cakes, or even the ""nearby grocery store"". 


EL: Ugh! I don't have time for that!! You are no help! This birthday is going to be ruined now because of you!! 
 

And with that she stomped off in a huff. Like seriously, don't get mad at me because you didn't plan your life better. If you're going to wait till last minute to buy a cake, why wouldn't you go to a grocery store or even a bakery that you know specializes in cakes. Why would you assume that a tiny mom and pop bakery that you've never been to before would just have full cakes at the ready?

Anyway, one Saturday night, I had a couple walk in for dinner. They would have been mid fifties and I was 20(M) at the time.

We were really quiet that night and they were quite talkative, so I ended up speaking with them for about 45 minutes and they were lovely people. We spoke about politics, sport, travelling just everything. Every time I'd go to leave them they would bring up another topic. Again, we were super quiet, so I didn't mind.

They end up finishing their dinner, pay and leave. They left a really nice tip (we're in a country where tipping isn't expected), but I thought that was the end of it.

Fast forward two weeks and I get a call in the restaurant for room service. They order and mention that it was the same couple from a couple of weeks ago and asked if I could bring it up for them. I thought it was strange they were staying at the hotel because they lived locally, but they were nice so I agreed.

I'm sure a few of you can see where this is heading. I take the room service up to them, I get to the door and they are those really heavy doors that don't stay open and are always locked from the outside. I knock, the guy says come in, the door is open. I push it open and see they have electrical tape over the lock to stop it closing. As I'm thinking how weird that is, I walk in to the room...

The wife is at the foot bed, wearing a mask on her face that had a dildo on the end of it, which was being used for pegging her husband who was lying on the bed. Next to them, I see a series of whips, anal beads and other apparatuses that I still have no idea what they are or what they do.

The husband says that I can do anything to him and his wife. He proceeds to piss on his wife while looking me dead in the eyes and repeats 'anything'.

I wish I could say I reacted in some cool way, but I was 20, didn't even know pegging was a thing and must have had this stunned mullet look on my face. I put the food down, turned around without saying a word and walked out. I never saw or heard from them again. 

This happened over a decade ago, but I still see it so vividly, it was the craziest thing to ever happen to me. They had obviously planned this, considering they gone out to get electrical tape to put over the lock.

My coworker let me know their reservation was at 4:45 and they were just early. Fine, no problem. They were no issue, great customers btw. 

Well my coworker also let me know we had a reservation of ***20*** at 6:00. I didn't really mind this, so I let the kitchen know ab the 20 top. I set up a group of booths, which were all connected. It's a little difficult to explain, but I'll do my best. There are a total of 4 booths. they kind of make a square shape together. So there are two sets of booths (connected, but separated by a removable barrier) that are side-by-side. Anyways the point is, the group of 20 would literally be right next to each other. 

Well, 6:00 comes around and the party comes in. I let a lady from the reservation know where they would be sitting. She looks back at her group and says they didn't like that spot, and would prefer to be on the wall (where the party of 9 have been sitting since 4:30, and the 20 top did not request this spot so we had the right to put them wherever was most convenient). I let the lady know that the wall section can only seat 16 people. The lady told me there are only 15 for her reservation. I tell the lady that she and her party can be seated now with what I have set up, or they can wait for the 9 top to leave, but we will have to give up the tables I set up prior. The lady tells me they'll wait. 

This irritated me a bit, but I remained friendly. About 20 minutes go by and a man from the reservation of 20 stops me as I walk by. 

*""Excuse me, may I speak to a manager?""*

*""Sure,""* I step away but turn back around, *""Is there an issue?""*

*""Yeah, we made this reservation two weeks ago and you guys don't even have a table set for us.""*

This took me by surprise. The lady who I spoke to (I'm assuming was his daughter or niece) must not have told him about our conversation. 

*""Oh! We did have a section for all of you,""* I point to the tables we reserved for them, *""we were under the impression that there were 20 of you, so we had to put the reservation there. But she told me you guys were okay with waiting until the other table on the wall left since you guys wanted to be put there.""*

At this point he looks at the lady I spoke to. If looks could kill, she'd be dead. 

*""Did you still want to see a manager?""* 

*""Nope, sorry.""*

I nod and walked away, but make my way back in their direction a few minutes later. The same man stopped me to complain about the 9 top not leaving yet.

 He asks, ""*Is there a reason why they're taking so long?""*

*""They're still eating and drinking. They should be leaving soon, they've been here a few hours.""*

*""Can't you just kick them out? We had a reservation.""*

At this point my mind was blown at this group's persistence. I told him I could not kick them out because they were paying customers, and had a reservation before they did. The group ended up leaving, writing a bad review on the restaurant, and calling to complain to the owner. Maybe if they ended up taking the table I set up for them, they wouldn't have this issue.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I clocked in at 4:30 yesterday afternoon and noticed a party of 9 in one of our sections.

Background:  I was hired on Monday, August 26 at a sit-down restaurant that serves lunch and dinner.   It's a franchise, there are two owners (not related by blood or marriage, one of them hired me) and the menu features lots of meat (but not steak).   There are &lt;20 servers, and &gt;5 of them are ""managers.""  3-4 lunch stations, 4-5 dinner stations.   Servers prebus, hostess busses/sets, servers make their own drinks.   P.O.S. POS, no training module.  Fairly upscale older residential area.   I have full availability/no schedule requirements.   I'm over 30 and was a server in college.

I'm sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring.  My stomach is in knots.  Spread out in front of me is a shit ton of paper from this place.   Training manual, policy manual, ""Five Day Training Schedule,"" four tests I've taken and passed, and the notes/answers for the 5th (final) test.   The official training schedule is supposed to be:    1) Shadow, 2) Hostess, 3) Shadow, 4) Expo, 5) Take final test and take tables with trainer watching.    I've completed (from oldest to newest):  Shadow (Tues), Expo (Wed), Hostess (Fri lunch) Shadow (Mon), Expo (Wed).    As I was finishing my assigned sidework on Wednesday, I asked a manager when my next shift was, and said (jokingly, but dead serious)  ""I can't wait to start taking tables!  I'm broke!""   The manager was clueless.  She called the owner (the other owner, not the one who hired me) and she walked away from me while she was talking to him on the phone.   I wanted to follow her so I could hear the conversation, but I was elbow-deep in sidework and couldn't extricate myself quickly enough.   When my sideworkwas finished, I walked to the managers' office and waited while she cashed out servers.   When she was done, she uttered the fateful line:   ""We messed up your training.  The owner will call you and tell you when to come in and finish your training.""

That was Wednesday.   It's now Friday, 4:45pm.   On Monday, it will be two weeks since I was hired!   What the actual fuck?!

I should mention that this manager--let's call her CJ, short for Criminal Justice (I overheard her telling someone her degree was in criminal justice) is the person who scheduled me and trained me for the first expo shift (out of order, it was supposed to come after the hostess shift and the 2nd shadow shift, although I don't see why the order would matter).  She also trained me for the 2nd expo shift, scheduled by the owner who hired me.

During both of my shadow shifts, my trainer was slammed, and exhausted from working a double.   I  didn't get to take any tables, but I was extremely helpful to my trainers and they made excellent tips.   My trainer's tables really liked me!  (""I like you!"" one guy exclaimed when I asked, ""Are you ready for another Margarita?"" which my trainer had neglected.   Another guy at a 3top (his 55ish dad's birthday dinner) said, ""You know, Sexybroth, if you were with my Dad you wouldn't have to work.   He's loaded!  And you're a great gal!"")    I haven't voiced this sentiment aloud, but service at this restaurant is fast-paced to the point of being graceless, in my opinion:   My 2nd trainer constantly auctioned off food,  passed dinner plates over guest's heads, whisked away mens' empty plates before their wives were finished, and read the specials at the breakneck speed of political ad disclaimers (“*XYZ PAC is responsible for the content of this advertising. Paid for by XYZ PAC and not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.*”)   I kept my mouth shut and didn't say anything negative, nor did I say anything annoying like ""I know"" when she taught me something.   I complimented her.  I thanked her for training me.  I worked hard, I smiled, I crawled under tables to retrieve green beans.  I volunteered to sweep when she said she hated sweeping.  I did everything she told me, except I couldn't (wouldn't) keep up with her because she was literally running.   At the end of the night, I overheard her proudly telling a manager, ""Sexybroth knows her table numbers!""

The suspense is killing me.   I called last night (Hello, this is Sexybroth.  I haven't heard from owner-who-didn't-hire-me, so I'm calling to see when I'm supposed to come in.""    A manager told me, ""Owner-who-didn't-hire-you has left for the day.  He'll be in tomorrow morning.""   I should mention that this owner has never said a single word to me.  He stares at me like I'm an alien, or a mentally-challenged  person.   It's now Friday, 4:45pm and he still hasn't called me.   What the ACTUAL FUCK?!?

Dear servers, please talk me through this!  It's giving me agita so bad I can't think straight.   I'm actually trembling.

Thank you for your advice!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please advise!   Background:  I was hired on Monday, August 26 at a sit-down restaurant that serves lunch and dinner.   It&amp;#39;s a franchise, there are two owners (not related by blood or marriage, one of them hired me) and the menu features lots of meat (but not steak).   There are &amp;lt;20 servers, and &amp;gt;5 of them are &amp;quot;managers.&amp;quot;  3-4 lunch stations, 4-5 dinner stations.   Servers prebus, hostess busses/sets, servers make their own drinks.   P.O.S. POS, no training module.  Fairly upscale older residential area.   I have full availability/no schedule requirements.   I&amp;#39;m over 30 and was a server in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring.  My stomach is in knots.  Spread out in front of me is a shit ton of paper from this place.   Training manual, policy manual, &amp;quot;Five Day Training Schedule,&amp;quot; four tests I&amp;#39;ve taken and passed, and the notes/answers for the 5th (final) test.   The official training schedule is supposed to be:    1) Shadow, 2) Hostess, 3) Shadow, 4) Expo, 5) Take final test and take tables with trainer watching.    I&amp;#39;ve completed (from oldest to newest):  Shadow (Tues), Expo (Wed), Hostess (Fri lunch) Shadow (Mon), Expo (Wed).    As I was finishing my assigned sidework on Wednesday, I asked a manager when my next shift was, and said (jokingly, but dead serious)  &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t wait to start taking tables!  I&amp;#39;m broke!&amp;quot;   The manager was clueless.  She called the owner (the other owner, not the one who hired me) and she walked away from me while she was talking to him on the phone.   I wanted to follow her so I could hear the conversation, but I was elbow-deep in sidework and couldn&amp;#39;t extricate myself quickly enough.   When my sideworkwas finished, I walked to the managers&amp;#39; office and waited while she cashed out servers.   When she was done, she uttered the fateful line:   &amp;quot;We messed up your training.  The owner will call you and tell you when to come in and finish your training.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was Wednesday.   It&amp;#39;s now Friday, 4:45pm.   On Monday, it will be two weeks since I was hired!   What the actual fuck?!&lt;/p&gt;

My family owned a restaurant. My mother bought and converted an old victorian home into a beautiful cafe with great ""from scratch"" food. For lack of a better term the place was instagrammable and a place you'd go for ""lunch with the girls"". As such we got a lot of ""Karens"" that would come in.

One lunch we were slammed busy and a 6 top were sat in my section. I get drinks and take their orders etc. One lady at the table, however, requests all kinds of changes to her order.  So many changes that she has, in fact, asked us to make a custom meal that was not on the menu. Things like adding bacon, cheddar, grilled onions, and peppers. These were things that were not on any other item on our menu so we did not have them ready-made. I go to consult the cook about it and he agreed but said that a custom order would take a bit longer to make and to make sure the woman knew that. I tell her and she said it was fine and she was willing to wait.

Yet again we are still slammed and I am running around serving tables like I am on fire. I keep the 6 top full on tea and water and assure them their order will be out shortly. They all seem fine and content except one lady. She was annoyed with the wait and continued to ask about the ETA of their order. I again reminded her of her friend's custom meal and that their orders are behind several other tables that had arrived/ordered before them.

Finally, their order is up.  I am in the kitchen loading up my tray. The cook tells me to take the first 5 and by the time I drop off the food, refill drinks and return, the custom order will be ready (I think he had it in the oven baking cheese onto it or something simple)  Normally you would try to take all the food out at once but since it was a small kitchen we didn't have to room to let food sit and get cold.

That's when shit hit the fan as I am putting plates down and about to explain to the custom order lady that her food is coming right up her friend interrupts me.

**(Karen: the friend of the custom order lady, Me: me, and Mom: my mother and owner of the cafe. )**

**Karen** ""This is just ridiculous! I just don't understand why it has taken this long to get our food!""

**Me** ""Her order is coming right up. It should be done by the time I get back to the kitchen. I am sorry for the wait but to make such an order the cook had to make all of the ingredients on the fly.""

**Karen** ""Even so it should have NEVER taken this long to cook such a simple request. We have been here for at least an hour ( this was a lie and they were told it was a wait when they were seated). Why would you agree to make it if it was going to take this long? Now you are telling me that you only have part of our order and our friend has to sit here without her food and watch us eat?!""

**Me** ""mam your friend was told her order would take longer and she agreed. It should be ready by now let me go check on that for you""

**Karen** ""You do that and while you're at it bring me a manager. I'd like to have a talk because I have been here several times and service has never been this poor and it has never taken this long.  It is unacceptable and just unprofessional and something needs to be done if you expect us to keep coming here""

I obliged, went to the kitchen and retrieve my mother. She had been in the kitchen the entire time prepping for a massive catering we had the next day. She approved the custom order and watched our cook bend over backward to please this table. She was aware of all of the complaints about how long it was taking them to make said order in the middle of a full house lunch rush.

One other thing it was an unspoken rule that my mother was not allowed on the floor unless it was absolutely necessary because though we worked in service and hospitality she did not abide by ""the customer is always right"" mantra and had zero tolerance and zero filter.

My mother stopped mid chop put down her knife (I had to tell her to put it down) and said ""I'll handle this"" and went to meet the table.

**Mom** ""hi ladies I'm told that you are unhappy with your meal""

**Karen** ""yes! I just don't understand why it has taken so long for my friend to receive her order and""

**Mom** \*cutting her off\* ""well hon that's what happens when you decide to make up your own menu but seeing as how we have failed you so miserably and nothing we do is going to make up for this I would suggest finding another place for lunch since we clearly cannot please you""

My mother proceeded to walk around the table pick up every plate, pull out chairs and hand the ladies their coats and purses one by one. The other ladies at the table who up until that point had just stared down at their plates while their friend was having a hissy fit and berating me looked up at my mother shocked and mortified

""What did we do!? We haven't said a thing!""

**Mom** ""Well, I suggest you make better friends and next time yall go out leave that miserable bitch at home"" \*she then herded them down the hall and out the front door like stunned sheep\*

It&amp;#39;s like the usual automated robot voice but turned up a hundred notches. There&amp;#39;s recorded &amp;quot;uhms&amp;quot; and the realisticness of the relay in a conversation and response time and rhythm are creepy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like cursing at it and telling the robot it&amp;#39;s creepy as I take down the new reservation information.  From now on I&amp;#39;m gonna just tell it to tell the guest we take reservations on Yelp and email or they can straight up call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone else get these? Apologies for mobile-written response.&lt;/p&gt;

I reckon we've got one of the best play areas in a 20-k radius, with lots of awnings and sails to protect people from the elements. Today was a glorious day, and glorious Friday afternoons always bring out the unprepared parents who, along with every other parent within a 2 block radius, thought taking the kids for a play (the kids) and a drink (the grown ups) was a great way to wrap up the week. 

Multiple complaints about how there was no space in the playground area and couldn't that just squeeze us onto that table that isn't due for another hour? Unfortunately, every last server has been burned by someone swearing it would be 'just one drink while they kids have a play, half an hour max' and then ordering plate after plate of food and refusing to leave once they're sat. And of course, we can't just TELL them that's why they can't sit there because we're effectively telling them we don't trust them (which we don't, but we can't say that). My favourite is a couple who do it to us almost every Friday, despite being told every PREVIOUS Friday that they really ought to make a booking. They say they'll book next Friday, never do, rinse and repeat. 

Then there was a group of women who managed to get a less-than-desirable table (2 adjacent high tops, not strictly in the playground area, 2x6 seaters for about 20 of them) and kept eyeing off the long table near them (20 seater made from multiple tables put together, regular height, clear line of sight from the playground, and under the heater because it still gets cold in the evenings) and started asking about it the second it hit their booking time (5) and no-one had shown up. The booking started trickling it about 530, so for the past half hour I had been refusing these women who were all 'by our kids have ordered food, they need to sit at a proper height table'. Ladies, I wasn't the one who showed up to a popular family-oriented bistro without a booking, squeezed 20 into a space meant for 12 and started pushing for someone's reservation the second they didn't show up on time.

(And yes, it frustrates me immensely when people book the most desirable areas and take their sweet time showing up and then only turn up with half their party; I'd love to create a policy where we'll only hold it for 15 minutes if there's a demand for the table, and at 30 minutes we're taking away all tables that aren't currently in use because half your party isn't here yet. But I think the group who bothered to book have a greater claim to the table than the group who showed up despite knowing its a popular place, a popular time and there are TWENTY of them!) 

I don't understand why people don't book before they come, for anything, let alone if their kids were really jonsing to go to THAT place. Do some people just not think that, hey, if \*we\* want to go to x bistro that has great food and a lovely area for the kids as a way to wrap up the school week, maybe dozens of \*other\* parents will also be thinking the same thing and it could get busy???

I really enjoy working there and often end up in that section because I'm good with kids. But some Friday afternoons just do my head in. I think because we've had a run of cold/wet weather followed by today, it brought it all the people who wanted to chill in the sun and have someone bring them beer.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in a family-friendly bistro in Perth, Western Australia.

  He came in and started with the small talk. He tells me he’s annoyed. His step son has an appointment at the doctors this afternoon so his gf isn’t available to take him to a nearby town if he feels like going.  I tell him he should take the bus. He says he shouldn’t have to take the bus when his gf drives. 


  He’s come up with a genius plan. He’s going to phone the doctors surgery up and cancel his step sons appointment so that it frees up his gf’s afternoon and then if he feels like going to a nearby town she can take him. 


 He asks me to turn the tv off so he can make a phone call. That’s a no from me. I advise him that he can go to a quieter part of the pub or he can go out into our beer garden.  There’s nobody out there and is quiet.  He decides to sit where he’s at and make the phone call anyway. 


 The two doctors surgery’s in our town share the same building. The receptions for both surgery are across the hall from each other. 
  He rings one surgery (it’s the wrong one but he already knows this). He explains he wants to cancel his step sons appt.  He doesn’t know his DOB, his doctor or the time of the appt.  the receptionist explains to him that she can’t cancel the appt if he doesn’t know any of this info. He then decides to tell her it’s for the other surgery, he doesn’t know the phone number but she could just pop across the hallway.  She gives him the number for the surgery and tells him that’s all she can do and hangs up. 


 He rings the other surgery and tries to cancel the appointment. He again tells the receptionist he doesn’t know the DOB and doesn’t know the correct spelling of the kids surname. The receptionist tells him that he can’t cancel the appointment without the right info.  He starts screaming at her about how outrageous that is and she should just take his word for it that he is who he says he is. She explains that it’s data protection and to prevent people from cancelling other peoples appointments without their permission. He declares he’s going to call the police on her for abusing his human rights and hangs up the phone. 


 He starts complaining to me about the health service and how it’s fucked. I asked him ‘what about your step sons right to see a doctor when he’s ill?’  I also mentioned that I hope he never tells me when he has a doctors appointment because I’ll keep ringing up to cancel them.

The summer before I started college my mum got me a job waitressing at her friend’s restaurant. 
It was a somewhat trendy fusion Asian restaurant with a dark moody decor, overpriced crappy food, 
and what I would come to find out, a horribly toxic work culture. 

They gave me the most basic of basic training: I think they taught me how to hold/serve a tray with food on it, 
how to take an order, and then just let me loose on customers. 

One of the managers Alex, a rotund gay Asian man with frosted tips that made his hair look like it was on fire with how 2000’s it was, immediately hated me. 
Maybe because my mum got me the job, maybe he just didn’t like me. Either way I was an awkward eighteen: naive, introverted, and didn’t stand up for myself.

He relentlessly scrutinised my work, and if he saw small flaws he would yell or make snide comments at me: he took me aside into a closet 
and yelled at me for minutes for having a wrinkly uniform (our uniform was a polo shirt and as an 18 year old, it never occurred to me to iron it), 
and for forgetting to grab a tray on my way to the pass and having to walk back to grab one. 

He would watch me like a hawk and take any opportunity to swipe at me. I remember I was holding a glass of water too close to the rim for his liking 
and before I could put it down on the table he barked “NO!!!!!” Loud enough to make me and the customer jump, and then stomped off. 
He wouldn’t explain why he yelled until later. Maybe it’s common sense but I hadn't been trained on that either. 

I remember he told me my glasses made me look unfriendly, and that I should smile more to compensate, amongst other comments on my appearance. 

I cried every day after work and In the end I decided I couldn’t take it and quit after 2 weeks. 
The owner moved me to his other restaurant where I did better. People were actually friendly and The manager there took me under her wing and trained me. 

After a couple weeks Alex came to visit the new restaurant to shoot the shit or whatever. I remember for the rest of that day the bartender 
was really short and tense with me, but it was busy and he was kind of a dick anyways, so I brushed it off. 
At the end of the night my new manager said I worked so hard that I could eat as much ice cream as I wanted out of the freezer. 
The bartender confessed that Alex had been going around saying I was lazy and badmouthing me to all the staff at the new restaurant behind my back.

The owner did nothing about Alex, I met other servers who had been bullied out of there, it must have been a habit of his. I think the owner kept Alex on because 
He was sugary sweet to customers, he would smile and dote on them, they ate him up.

When I would come home and cry, my mum told me I just needed thicker skin, that all jobs were like that.
It has been many years and jobs since, and I have never worked in another workplace so toxic, fuck that place.

The server who took care of her the previous night was on shift, so she slams the menu down and goes &amp;quot;I want to speak to him because clearly you&amp;#39;re new here.&amp;quot; Normally I try and kill them with kindness but I was shocked. &amp;quot;Excuse me miss what was that?&amp;quot; And she repeated &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re obviously new here I want to speak to him.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I clear my throat and said &amp;quot;Actually ma&amp;#39;am I opened this store 3 years ago and have been here the entire time and I am a server trainer and I&amp;#39;ve actually been here longer than he has. But I&amp;#39;ll go get him =]&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he proceeded to explain that he did charge them while I stood right next to him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and she apologized for the trouble but not to me, to a hostess that I made take her order because I refused to take care of her anymore after she said the other server who corrected her was the only helpful person in the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still think about this incident to this day.../endrant&lt;/p&gt;

Today I was having a pretty shitty day and 1 part of this couple that are regular of mine comes in. Ahhh such a good time. So this couple I call gout and heckler. So I ll explain their names. Gout earned his name the day one of my co workers and his friends come in. So this couple comes and sits next to my co worker at the bar. I see him limping and taking a seat almost stumbling. (Btw I have never met anyone with gout until my co worker recently was diagnosed with it 2 weeks earlier.) so I ask this guy do we need to cut you off before you even start.  He replies sorry man I just have gout.  
I am literally like wtf I never heard of gout in my entire life and now I have met two guys with it this month. So I said no way, your the second guy to tell me this recently and I have never heard of it. What are the odds both of you are sitting at my bar right now. 
I introduce them and we have a couple laughs a make their drinks we laugh a bit they order food they love it. I don’t know how we got to the conversation but we started talking about rude customers and how they act like we don’t have any control over the type of service they receive. He jokingly said you’d probably stab them one of these days if they tip you badly.
I jokingly respond maybe. I even know where to hide the body too. That makes them laugh so hard. So blah blah blah toward the end I hand them the check and he pays and the girl turns to him and says did you leave a good tip. He hands me the check with such confidence and says yes I left a good tip. 
I look at her and she’s laughs and says he’ll stab you. I  put the book down and slide it back and say I’ll give you a min to rethink the tip. He busts out laughing and says that’s amazing. I walk away come back and he says just for that I left you and extra twenty. That was epic. So that’s gout.

Heckler origin story.
The couples come back and they request me they thought I forgot who they were. The girl says it’s us remember gout foot that’s him. As she’s shoving her finger into his chest pointing at him. So I remember who that is obviously. They sit and I give them my spiel then ask for drink orders and offer them more time if they needed. They both say they are ready. She gives me her Order. He looks at the menu and being unsure of what he wants. She turns to me and say I am so sorry. Then turns to him. She says, hey you do know he has other people to wait on!! chop chop!! we don’t got all day! You said you were ready. Let’s gooooo!! I couldn’t stop laughing. I turn to her and ask her where she’s been my entire serving life and would she like to be my serving assistant? I need her. I must have her around for situations like this. He orders his drink and we move on. So this woman spent the entire dinner just making these types of comments when ever he spoke. My side hurt from laughing so hard. I told her damn your brutal you’re like the person in the crowd that boos someone at a performance. I then officially name them heckler and gout. Anytime you come in and I am busy. I promise you if you tell the hostess it’s you I’ll make the time for you. Just let them tell me heckler and gout are here. I got you. 
Omg almost forgot the best part. So they end up turning to me. Btw what is your name. I look at them I gave you my name 2 times now you should know it. If you can guess my name right I’ll hook you with a discount. I’ll even give you a clue my name is also a name for a religion.  I felt like I basically gave them my name. I said I’ll box your food while you guys think about it. I come back and ask if they figured it out. Gouts like Jew? Lol I am like wtf really. I am like okay one more Catholics are in the same branch. They were clueless. I just laughed and told them my name. I sure someone has figured out my name.

I had this 2 top last week, one ordered steak and lobster and one ordered the chicken. They were a super nice couple who I got along with well.

They had said they knew another server who worked there and asked me to be honest with them - and asked “are your steaks frozen?” I looked at them and gave them a look, which obviously meant yes. They both nodded and said “well your manager just straight up lied to us and told us nothing in the restaurant is frozen and everything comes fresh daily” which is complete BS!

When his new steak came out I checked on him and he said this one was incredible- so much better than the first which tasted freezer burnt in his opinion.

When I confronted him, pointed at the list and told him it clearly says to clean the toilets, he flat out refused and left without the closers, one other and I, signing off on it. The manager on shift, who has barely been working there longer than me, witnessed the whole thing and did nothing. 
My SO thinks next time it’s my turn to clean the bathroom, I should tell them I won’t until it’s enforced for everyone. Do you think that’s the best thing to do? This isn’t the first time I’ve had issues with this person. What do you think I should do?

EDIT: Well, this has been eye-opening for sure! I thought my coworker was just being lazy/rude to not to what was asked of the rest of us but from what it sounds like in the comments, maybe the owner is at fault here and we shouldn’t be doing it in the first place.

This happened a few weeks ago, but my restaurant just received the complaint letter yesterday. I work for a casual upscale restaurant in a busy area of my town. We have a lot of regulars, but we also get a lot of vacationers and people who are celebrating occasions. A standard bill for a 4-top at dinner is usually upwards of $250. 

A few weeks ago I served this family. They claimed that they had a reservation when they walked in, but they did not. When they threw a fit, apparently my managers gave in and sat them right away..in my section. Totally fine, I have no control over who gets sat in my section when, so I went into the table with my standard style of service. They were celebrating not one, but two birthdays. Great!! I wished them happy birthday, we chatted about their birthday plans, and made nice conversation throughout their entire meal. 

Now before I continue, I need to talk about my company’s birthday policy. We will not offer anything complementary for a birthday. If we know you are celebrating a birthday, though, and you order dessert, we will put candles in your desert and wish you a happy birthday again. We will not sing, we will not clap, we will not do anything over the top because that’s just not us as a company. 

So the family finished their meals, and it comes time for dessert. I ask if they would like to finish the meal with one of our five dessert options, or any after dinner cocktails or beverages. They all happily decline, they are stuffed and have had a great time. Great again! Another point for me. 

So I loop back around and drop the check at their table, and the father gives me a look like I just kicked one of his children. “Don’t you do anything for birthdays? We have two.” I tell him “we do not do anything complementary,” and then go through the candle thing with desserts. He proceeds to throw his card down on the check and wave me away. 

I run his card and let a manager know what’s going on. The manager isn’t inclined to do anything for them, we already sat them almost immediately after they should have waited the 1 hour wait time. I drop their charge, wish them a happy birthday again, and be on my way. I thought nothing else of it, I did nothing wrong, they were upset with a policy that I was just there to abide by. 

Fast forward to today, and my manager pulls me aside to read a letter that we received. It is titled “WORST BIRTHDAY EVER!!!!!” The 5 exclamation points really got the point across. The father from the family wrote in to tell my company that I was the worst server they had ever experienced. I did not acknowledge their birthday celebration, didn’t ask who was having a birthday, and did not offer free dessert. NOTHING. (Direct quote, there were lots of capital letters). I ruined their birthday, and they will never return. 

Please people, for the love of all the servers taking care of you, DO NOT GET MAD AT US FOR A POLICY THAT WE DIDNT MAKE. Do I hate telling people we don’t do complementary birthday things. Duh! It sucks! But I don’t make the policy. We want to give you cool Birthday perks just as much as you want them. Also, do not make shit up about your server in an angry letter because we were following said policy.

Now to preface, I'm the guy at work who always has a smile and a good attitude. It takes a lot to really get under my skin and even get me to break down as this Karen did to me. TL;DR at the bottom. 

This happened about two months ago. I was working a double and it was the last shift of about 12 days working in a row and it was also the day before I was to leave to visit some family for two weeks. Also, I had a terrible toe infection so it made walking difficult (don't worry, I got it checked out while on vacation so its all better now). Anyways, I was tired as could be, I was limping all day and therefore was slower than usual, but I managed to slap a smile on my face and just focused on making some money. 

However, things turned a bit for the worse when we got slammed for our busy lunch rush. I had 6 tables (4 4-tops, a 2-top, and an 8 top) and was getting double and triple sat. Whatever, I handled it like a pro and managed to make sure everyone had what they needed. In the middle of the rush, I get my first 6 top at my big table and it was a family with 3 adults and 3 kids. Easy--or so I thought.

I greet the family, do my spiel, and offer drinks to start. The adults want bottled waters and two juices for two kids and one of the older kids asks for just water. So, I grab their drinks at the soda station around the corner from the table and bring them out promptly. The dad immediately pushes back the water from the kid and sternly says, ""What is this?"" I tell the dad it's water because thats what his son asked for. The guy shakes his head and sternly says, ""No bring him a bottled water!"" I grab the water away from the table and go grab a bottled water. Alright, I see how this table is going to be, but maybe it'll get better. I drop off the bottled water, grab their orders, and go to ring them in.

Some time passes, and their apps drop, and every time I pass by the table one of the adults is always stopping me for something (more napkins, more bread, more sauce, etc.) and at this point I put on my blank server face: you know the one where you aren't smiling or frowning, but just going through the motions as demands are thrown your way and you try to not show your frustration, but there's no point smiling at people who are being rude to you. Anyways, I get them everything they need, lunch comes out quickly and they seem content--for now.

Now you're probably wondering where the hell Karen is in all of this, considering I didn't mention her--yet. Don't worry, in Karen fashion, she will enter the stage and put on her long-awaited performance. Towards the end of this 6 top's lunch, they ask me for boxes to go and a slice of cake (I should mention, my work is known for their desserts). So I tell them ok, run over towards the POS, ring in their cake, print their bill, and turn around to see I've been doubled sat. Great, it'll slow me down a bit, but it's okay this table doesn't seem to be in too much of a rush--right? Wrong.

I go to greet my two new tables and grab their drink orders and then I can go to the line and grab some togo boxes. I turn away from my new tables and head in the direction where my 6 top family is at. One the ladies who kept demanding stuff from me flashes the nastiest look ever and I look over and see her husband doing the same face (well fuck what is wrong now?) As I approach the table, the lady screams out ""WHERE ARE OUR TOGO BOXES?! WE ARE LOW ON TIME! WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW!"" Now like I said, I'm a pretty smiley, good attitude kinda person. Rarely do I wear my emotions on my face or talk back to a table. Well, this lady just pushed my buttons. I look her sternly and say ""I said I will be right back with your boxes in a moment. Here's your check."" I slammed the check book onto the table and walked away. Now, you're probably wondering was that it? Was that the Karen that made you cry? No, that was not Karen. That was Linda. 

So I walk off to a different POS so that I could ring in drink orders and then walk over to grab their cake that was sitting in the bakery window. Now to set the stage, the area I am walking through to get to the other POS is in our bar section which consists of high tops on the left of me and the bar on the right side. As I get near the POS, I walk pass a high top of two middle-aged ladies. I hear one of them say to me ""Excuse me, can you take our payment? We haven't seen our server and we need to go back to work. Service has been so slow it's ridiculous!"" Now, I'm still in a bad mood, but whatever, I like to help my fellow servers out and considering THEIR server was at the adjacent high top taking an order, I figured I could help these ladies out, so I say ""Sure I'll take care of that."" The lady who called me for my attention tells me she has $30 on her gift card and the rest on her friends' card. 

So I take the payment over to the POS and take the payment. However, the gift card only rings for $10 even though the lady told me it had $30 on it. Shit, I think to myself. I turn around and walk back over to the two ladies. ""Sorry ma'am, but did you say the card had $30 on it because only $10 came off of it."" Well, you were all waiting for it...

""EXCUSE ME? THATS NOT RIGHT! THERE'S $30 ON THAT GIFT CARD! I KNOW THERE IS BECAUSE I WAS AT ANOTHER LOCATION WHICH HAD TERRIBLE SERVICE AND THEY GAVE ME THE GIFT CARD FOR $30!"" And so Karen begins her show. She starts going off on me all the while pulling out a gift card activation slip that shows she got the card back in May, meaning it's likely she used the card between May and July. She throws the slip at me and I tell her, ""Well ma'am, did you maybe use this card before? It's only showing $10 left on it."" And I swear to God, this lady just blew up like I told her to go jump in front of a bus (I should've, I really should've told her). ""THIS IS RIDICULOUS! THE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE HERE, THE FOOD TOOK TOO LONG! I AM RUNNING LATE TO WORK! I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!"" And she just keeps going and going while her friend sits there awkwardly and who even tries to tell me to put the rest on her card. 

After taking a moment's beating I finally scream out ""Well what do you want me to do?! I'm just telling you what the computer says is on the card and I have nothing else to do with it. Do you want me to take the payment or not?!"" I could feel my face turning hot and my body twitching in frustration and anger. I was so fed up. This Karen, who was not even my table nor had any prior interaction with me, decides to take out all of her frustration on me, the person who was simply helping her out to take a payment. On top of that, I had a shitty 6 top that was being nothing but rude to me, I was working nonstop for almost two weeks, and I had an infection on my toe. I had it. I absolutely had it. Finally, Karen whips out her card and throws it at me. I take it and walk over to the POS where I throw the check book and her card at the screen. I break down, ugly crying and struggling to breathe because I'm so frustrated and upset that I just lost it. The lovely bartender who was standing nearby rushed over to my aid and did her best to calm me down, but I couldn't calm down, I was shaking, and I'm not the type to break down and ugly cry like that. I RARELY CRY (nothing to brag about, but I just never really cry, I just get mad and annoyed). 

After a moment, my sweet manager comes by and I tell her what happened. I then look up and see my 6 top trying to LEAVE without paying me FIRST. I yell at my manager ""You need to go over to that table because she just yelled at me and I did nothing wrong to her and my other table who was being shitty to me  is trying to leave without paying!"" My manager tells me to go to the back and takes care of the two tables. I made sure to walk by the high top so that they (well, mostly Karen) could see what they did to me. 

After cooling down, I go back onto the floor and see I have a new table and one of my other tables is ready to pay. I do my best to act friendly and smile, but they can see how upset I am, even one table asks if everything is okay. At the end of that, I got some pity tips from my tables. Later on, I go to find my manager who told me that the high top was being problematic all day and the server even told me he felt bad for how they treated me and they were rude from the start. I also found out from my manager that my 6 top family tried to walk out and she took their cash payment. They left a $3 tip on their $100 tab and so my manager comped off their apps to give me a $25 tip which was really nice and unexpected. After that, I managed to finish my double limping throughout it and had a relatively good night.

However, even after that incident, I still have this frustration with the industry. Working in the restaurant industry for 5 years now, I've met some really crappy and rude people, some people who pushed me to my limit. But I never had someone that just took out all of their anger on a stranger, let alone someone who had nothing to do with their dining experience. It just really hit me and made me realize how much I want to leave the industry, but then I realize I enjoy the work and the money and the people you get to meet. I hope that lady comes in again someday and I can give her a piece of my mind.

Thanks everyone for reading this story. 

TL;DR I get stuck serving a shitty family of 6 who was nothing but rude and demanding, and when I try to escape from them I walk right into Karen's den and get viciously attacked which results in me ugly crying in front of everyone","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the title states, this tale is about how a Karen and another table made me cry. Now to preface, I&amp;#39;m the guy at work who always has a smile and a good attitude. It takes a lot to really get under my skin and even get me to break down as this Karen did to me. TL;DR at the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happened about two months ago. I was working a double and it was the last shift of about 12 days working in a row and it was also the day before I was to leave to visit some family for two weeks. Also, I had a terrible toe infection so it made walking difficult (don&amp;#39;t worry, I got it checked out while on vacation so its all better now). Anyways, I was tired as could be, I was limping all day and therefore was slower than usual, but I managed to slap a smile on my face and just focused on making some money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, things turned a bit for the worse when we got slammed for our busy lunch rush. I had 6 tables (4 4-tops, a 2-top, and an 8 top) and was getting double and triple sat. Whatever, I handled it like a pro and managed to make sure everyone had what they needed. In the middle of the rush, I get my first 6 top at my big table and it was a family with 3 adults and 3 kids. Easy--or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I greet the family, do my spiel, and offer drinks to start. The adults want bottled waters and two juices for two kids and one of the older kids asks for just water. So, I grab their drinks at the soda station around the corner from the table and bring them out promptly. The dad immediately pushes back the water from the kid and sternly says, &amp;quot;What is this?&amp;quot; I tell the dad it&amp;#39;s water because thats what his son asked for. The guy shakes his head and sternly says, &amp;quot;No bring him a bottled water!&amp;quot; I grab the water away from the table and go grab a bottled water. Alright, I see how this table is going to be, but maybe it&amp;#39;ll get better. I drop off the bottled water, grab their orders, and go to ring them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time passes, and their apps drop, and every time I pass by the table one of the adults is always stopping me for something (more napkins, more bread, more sauce, etc.) and at this point I put on my blank server face: you know the one where you aren&amp;#39;t smiling or frowning, but just going through the motions as demands are thrown your way and you try to not show your frustration, but there&amp;#39;s no point smiling at people who are being rude to you. Anyways, I get them everything they need, lunch comes out quickly and they seem content--for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you&amp;#39;re probably wondering where the hell Karen is in all of this, considering I didn&amp;#39;t mention her--yet. Don&amp;#39;t worry, in Karen fashion, she will enter the stage and put on her long-awaited performance. Towards the end of this 6 top&amp;#39;s lunch, they ask me for boxes to go and a slice of cake (I should mention, my work is known for their desserts). So I tell them ok, run over towards the POS, ring in their cake, print their bill, and turn around to see I&amp;#39;ve been doubled sat. Great, it&amp;#39;ll slow me down a bit, but it&amp;#39;s okay this table doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be in too much of a rush--right? Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go to greet my two new tables and grab their drink orders and then I can go to the line and grab some togo boxes. I turn away from my new tables and head in the direction where my 6 top family is at. One the ladies who kept demanding stuff from me flashes the nastiest look ever and I look over and see her husband doing the same face (well fuck what is wrong now?) As I approach the table, the lady screams out &amp;quot;WHERE ARE OUR TOGO BOXES?! WE ARE LOW ON TIME! WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW!&amp;quot; Now like I said, I&amp;#39;m a pretty smiley, good attitude kinda person. Rarely do I wear my emotions on my face or talk back to a table. Well, this lady just pushed my buttons. I look her sternly and say &amp;quot;I said I will be right back with your boxes in a moment. Here&amp;#39;s your check.&amp;quot; I slammed the check book onto the table and walked away. Now, you&amp;#39;re probably wondering was that it? Was that the Karen that made you cry? No, that was not Karen. That was Linda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I walk off to a different POS so that I could ring in drink orders and then walk over to grab their cake that was sitting in the bakery window. Now to set the stage, the area I am walking through to get to the other POS is in our bar section which consists of high tops on the left of me and the bar on the right side. As I get near the POS, I walk pass a high top of two middle-aged ladies. I hear one of them say to me &amp;quot;Excuse me, can you take our payment? We haven&amp;#39;t seen our server and we need to go back to work. Service has been so slow it&amp;#39;s ridiculous!&amp;quot; Now, I&amp;#39;m still in a bad mood, but whatever, I like to help my fellow servers out and considering THEIR server was at the adjacent high top taking an order, I figured I could help these ladies out, so I say &amp;quot;Sure I&amp;#39;ll take care of that.&amp;quot; The lady who called me for my attention tells me she has $30 on her gift card and the rest on her friends&amp;#39; card. &lt;/p&gt;

I turn around and walk back over to the two ladies. &amp;quot;Sorry ma&amp;#39;am, but did you say the card had $30 on it because only $10 came off of it.&amp;quot; Well, you were all waiting for it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;EXCUSE ME? THATS NOT RIGHT! THERE&amp;#39;S $30 ON THAT GIFT CARD! I KNOW THERE IS BECAUSE I WAS AT ANOTHER LOCATION WHICH HAD TERRIBLE SERVICE AND THEY GAVE ME THE GIFT CARD FOR $30!&amp;quot; And so Karen begins her show. She starts going off on me all the while pulling out a gift card activation slip that shows she got the card back in May, meaning it&amp;#39;s likely she used the card between May and July.

Now, this may give away where I live, but recently my State instituted a 10 cent charge for bags. It's been maybe a month and it was all over the news... there were crazy local reports of pregnant women being forced to carry groceries to their car crying or whatever... Yeah completely overblown reaction but we are taxed to a ridiculous extent here and lots of people won't pay for the bag just because of that. It's kind of a dumb law in my opinion, but it's a law.

We have a regular togo guest that orders for their entire office online and pays online (you don't have to, they just do), and they're picky so we double check their entire order. They ordered just an hour ago, it was a $200 order with lunch combo food and other honestly amazing deals that really from $8 to $20ish for two orders. My GM put it together because we had no togo scheduled.

So the two ladies that always pick it up come in right after another lady who ordered togo, and when I mentioned the 10 cent charge, they flip out. I said I'd ask my manager, but it was a law and we'd have to charge somehow.

They claimed to have no money on them, so the crew very nicely told them we'd pay for their bags... I told them it was a one time thing, a message my GM approved. They continued to be rude, telling me ""Do you really expect us to carry all this to our cars with no bags?"" The lady who had just gotten their order offered to pay for their bags... sure, whatever, they aren't worth it, but sure. We thanked the lady profusely and sent all of them on their merry way after baging this huge order.

They call back just now, an hour later, claimed they were waiting 15 minutes for their order, that so and so got avocados on them (it comes with them) and bunch of other bullshit... My GM is on the phone and I was so proud... he didn't give them any store credit and calmly explained why each and every one of their claims was just, well, not our fault. Straight up told them we double checked their order and when it left the restaurant, no there was no blue cheese crumbles on the buffalo chicken salad. Explained the wait was because we had to bag their food, and it didn't take more than 5 minutes. Was reamed out on the other line, and his response, ""My crew offered to pay for your bags out of their own pockets.""

Honestly major props to my manager standing up to them at this corporate ass restaurant... he was completely fed up with them.

I'm just flabbergasted... we didn't choose this, it's the law. We even offered to pay for the bags, and you choose to make bs complaints we can disprove by looking at your order? 

I can't wait for next week because if they don't pay for the bags themselves, I'm not giving them any, I'll even tell other guests not to pay for their bags because they did the same thing last week and I told them they had to pay next time or bring their own bags. And then they can carry $200 worth of food and condiments to their car themselves! 

TLDR: Togo regulars freak out at surcharge on bags, we offer to pay out of our own pockets for them, then they call to complain about easily disproved bs. Next week if they don't pay, I'm planning on making them carry $200 worth of food and condiments out. I'll offer to help them so they can't have any shit to complain about!

EDIT: Lots of people giving suggestions in the comments... It's a corporate store and we have thousands of locations. No one I ever work with can do anything about what bags we use or the website. I see the Vice Director of Operations for the Eastern Seaboard (think that's his title) once a year for a minute, but I probably shouldn't use that minute to complain to my bosses bosses bosses bosses bosses, etc. boss about bags...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On phone. tldr at bottom&lt;/p&gt;

I no longer serve, but the memories stay for ever. 

For reference I worked at the time in a small gastropub that had a special prefix brunch show in the pup room and regular, more calm brunch in the back room. 

The general rule of thumb was that during brunch girls serve in the front and boys serve in the back. This was true for the most part except we didn’t have a shift manager to enforce this just a part time server who liked to boss people around. Well call him “manager.” He refused to work in the same room as me, and would throw his hands up in the air and say “absolutely not” if the owner requested it. I was fine with working in the back, we sometimes I had parties back there and I’m very good at serving parties, which most of my coworkers hated. 

This particular day was sort of busy, nothing out of the ordinary for a brunch shift. I was working both brunch shift and dinner shift this day. There wasn’t a party so the back was open to anyone who didn’t have tickets to the brunch show. I get condemned the back by the “manager,” fine okay. 

I have four four tops and a 6 top. My first 4 top to arrive and unusual demands like “can you do chicken and waffles but with the pumpkin waffle” chef doesn’t like to do requests on busy brunch shifts because it complicates things for him. I explain this, they ask “well will you just ask him” the group was real nice so I did knowing that the answer would still be the same. I come back up and tell them, they’re like “okay fine just the regular chicken and waffles” 

I immediately go and put the order through to KBS and chef send the runner upstairs to tell me that they’re backed up on waffles and it’ll be a while. It’s important to note no one told me WHY we were backed up on waffles and NONE of my other tables ordered any waffle verity. I tell the group and again they’re very nice and they’re like “oh yeah no problem” I immediately suggest some appetizers so they’re not starved while they wait and get those to the table. 

I’m taking care of my other tables, this 4 top had their apps but still haven’t gotten their waffles. They’re looking over at me as I bus my other tables, kinda annoyed looking. I go over and explain one more time that they’ll get their food as soon as possible. In this time the chef told me to 86 all future waffle orders and if anyone asks the waffle iron is broken. It’s not broken completely he can just only make one waffle at a time. Boss was on their way with a new waffle iron. 

So I get a new table, introduce myself, talk about drinks, the works and say “unfortunately our waffle machine is broken so we can’t accommodate any waffles” the guy who seemed to be the leader of this group immediately stands up, comes to my table and starts berating me “WHAT YOU MEAN WERE NOT GETTING OUR WAFFLES THAT WE ORDERED A HALF HOUR AGO???” And I say “sir I’m working with other guests right now please go sit down and I will come over in just a few minuets and explain” he comes back with “NO I WANT THE MANAGER” 

Of course we don’t have a manager, but I tell him “alright, I will send the manager over to speak with you but please sit down, I have other guests to also accommodate” I got to tell “Manger” what’s going on and he’s like “okay I’ll handle it.” My boss had told me that I have to be friendly with him even though he hates me so I’m like “great thanks man” 

While “manager” has a lot of tables he’s doing literally nothing while I help run food he refuses to run for his table, so the runner doesn’t have to run up and down the stairs to the kitchen a million times. He’s talking to another sever and he says “haha I’m not going to go talk to her table, I hope this blows up and she finally gets fired” 

So knowing this, I have this guy from the table following me around while I check on all his other tables. It’s only been ten minutes since he’s freaked out about not getting his waffles, and I sternly tell him to go sit down. He orders a drink from the bar but the bartenders transfers it to my tab because she knows he’s being an ass. 

FINALLY the waffles they order come up and the table says “NOPE WEVE WAITED 45 MINUTES NO MANAGER EVER CAME TO TALK TO US THIS IS UNEXECPTABLE” and they walk out. I was going to comp the food on their bill, all of it. They walked out and I now have 4 waffles sitting there. They refused to even have them wrapped up. 

So guys, what does manager do? He calls boss and says “bby fucked up and her table left screaming I don’t know what happened, but she should really get spoken too.” 

My boss came in (with a new waffle iron yay!) and sat me down for a chat. I explained my situation, the bartender backed me up, the chef backed me up. “Manager” has a totally different story. So I wasnt fired and I faced no consequences. 

Eventually since my boss wouldn’t do it the chef had a conversation with “manager” where he can’t be mean to me and continue brewing up these plots to get me fired just because he doesn’t like me and that we’re a team here. It helped a little. 

If you guys like this I have more “me vs manager stories” where he cuts me out of tip pools, set my pin to not send orders to the kitchen, etc.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey this is my first post here! I no longer serve, but the memories stay for ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference I worked at the time in a small gastropub that had a special prefix brunch show in the pup room and regular, more calm brunch in the back room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general rule of thumb was that during brunch girls serve in the front and boys serve in the back. This was true for the most part except we didn’t have a shift manager to enforce this just a part time server who liked to boss people around. Well call him “manager.” He refused to work in the same room as me, and would throw his hands up in the air and say “absolutely not” if the owner requested it. I was fine with working in the back, we sometimes I had parties back there and I’m very good at serving parties, which most of my coworkers hated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular day was sort of busy, nothing out of the ordinary for a brunch shift. I was working both brunch shift and dinner shift this day. There wasn’t a party so the back was open to anyone who didn’t have tickets to the brunch show. I get condemned the back by the “manager,” fine okay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have four four tops and a 6 top. My first 4 top to arrive and unusual demands like “can you do chicken and waffles but with the pumpkin waffle” chef doesn’t like to do requests on busy brunch shifts because it complicates things for him. I explain this, they ask “well will you just ask him” the group was real nice so I did knowing that the answer would still be the same. I come back up and tell them, they’re like “okay fine just the regular chicken and waffles” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately go and put the order through to KBS and chef send the runner upstairs to tell me that they’re backed up on waffles and it’ll be a while. It’s important to note no one told me WHY we were backed up on waffles and NONE of my other tables ordered any waffle verity. I tell the group and again they’re very nice and they’re like “oh yeah no problem” I immediately suggest some appetizers so they’re not starved while they wait and get those to the table. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m taking care of my other tables, this 4 top had their apps but still haven’t gotten their waffles. They’re looking over at me as I bus my other tables, kinda annoyed looking. I go over and explain one more time that they’ll get their food as soon as possible. In this time the chef told me to 86 all future waffle orders and if anyone asks the waffle iron is broken. It’s not broken completely he can just only make one waffle at a time. Boss was on their way with a new waffle iron. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I get a new table, introduce myself, talk about drinks, the works and say “unfortunately our waffle machine is broken so we can’t accommodate any waffles” the guy who seemed to be the leader of this group immediately stands up, comes to my table and starts berating me “WHAT YOU MEAN WERE NOT GETTING OUR WAFFLES THAT WE ORDERED A HALF HOUR AGO???” And I say “sir I’m working with other guests right now please go sit down and I will come over in just a few minuets and explain” he comes back with “NO I WANT THE MANAGER” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we don’t have a manager, but I tell him “alright, I will send the manager over to speak with you but please sit down, I have other guests to also accommodate” I got to tell “Manger” what’s going on and he’s like “okay I’ll handle it.” My boss had told me that I have to be friendly with him even though he hates me so I’m like “great thanks man” &lt;/p&gt;

The year is 2016; I am a college student waiting my way through college at generic Italian chain B. I pride myself in being a good server by checking on my tables frequently but not obnoxiously and by generally reading their body language to see if they are actually enjoying themselves when not being asked. Tips here are average (15-20%). On this particular evening I had 2 guests seated on one side of a booth (hereafter referred to as Couple). 

Me: Good evening folks my name is AbrahamLeo I’ll be taking care of you this evening.

Couple: Great, actually we are waiting on one more

Me: (yay I love when parties come in waves instead of all at once /s) Great, can I get you folks going on some drinks or an app while we wait?

Couple: a couple of waters and generic local drafts please.

Coming right up. I run off to grab their drinks for them and after a reasonable amount of time their third person arrives (hereafter referred to as BT for Bad Tipper).

Me: How are you doing this evening? Can I get you something to drink

BT: I’ll take generic cocktail

The rest of the meal goes off without a hitch. Their body language is happy and they say they have everything they need every time I check in with the table. Heck the guys even get a second round of drinks.

It’s time for the check and unsurprisingly the couple is on one and BT is on the other. The couple tips about 20% and BT tips about 5%... I chalk it up to well that sucks and bitch about it to my coworkers as we all tend to do, but let it go until… 

flashforward a few days later at college. My classmates and I are few minutes early for class and are waiting for the class in front of us to end and that’s when I realize BT is in my class, and so I find myself in the unique position of actually finding out what I did to apparently piss this guy off.  

Me: (casually) Hey weren’t you at generic restaurant B this weekend?

BT: (also casually) yeah catching up with friends

Me: (still casually) yeah, I was your waiter. You guys looked like you had a good time. So is there a reason you tip only 5%?

BT: (obviously taken aback at being confronted) what?

Me: is there a reason you tipped so badly? I’d like to know so I can avoid in the future (kinda but mostly cause fuck you I want to put you on the spot). 

BT: Honestly? Water.

Me: what about water?

BT: You never got me water

Me: you never asked for water

BT: You got my friends water.

Me: your friends asked for water along with their drinks. You never once thought to ask for water in the 6 times I came to ask you if you need *anything else* or like when you ordered a second generic cocktail after I asked if I could you guys another drink? 

BT: You should have gotten me water man. (because how could he possibly in the wrong)

Me: That is one of the pettiest reasons I have ever heard for leaving a shitty tip. A 5% tip for not getting you something you *never* asked for?  5% to server might as well be a slap in the face. 5% is “fuck you, you were bad, and I want you to know I thought you were bad.” Next time you feel like tipping that low they better have forgotten to order your food, brought it out cold, never asked you about it and then charged you full price when you brought it up. 

BT: (Shrugs) you should have gotten me water

Me: oh fuck off, (and walkaway)

Then everybody stood up and clapped while chanting “You suck” until BT broke down crying and hung his head in shame (Not really. That shit doesn’t happen in real life, but he did avoid sitting anywhere near me the rest of the semester).

He was very surprised, and tipped stupid. Like 40% or something, which turned out to be kinda a fluke. 

After that I'd go out of my way to surprise them the strangest way possible. If they said ""surprise me"" on sides, I'd do loaded applesauce. Which is applesauce with marshmallow fluff and I think caramel. Cost a dollar more, never got a conplaint. They load it like they do the sweet potato.

We operate a little differently than a lot of traditional restaurants. For example, we're supposed to take drink and food orders at the same time (not bring out drinks before ordering). We also don't have appetizers. It's short order cooking and we bring food out as it's ready, not all at once.

So this happened last night.

A family of 3 comes in anf sits in my section. I greet them and ask if they're ready to order. Because we are such a large national chain, mist people already know what they want to order, so getting the drink order at the same time works pretty well. On slower shifts (like weekday overnights) we will go ahead and get drinks if the customers want to look over the menu or are waiting for more people to come.

So, anyway, the mom says ""I'll have one of these side salads"". I ask for the other orders but tthen she says she just wants it while they decide on the rest of the order. As I mentioned, that's not something we normally do, but whatever, customer's always right, so I go to get her salad.

Now, as you can imagine, we don't sell a lot of salads. They are just premade salad mix (the ole standard lettuce, carrots and purple cabbage mix)-nothing fancy. I bring her salad out and again ask if they're ready to order. They are still looking (since it's only been like 45 seconds) so I offer to get them drinks. The mom also requests some crackers. I bring the crackers first but when I return with the drinks she tells me the crackers are stale.

Again, we do not sell many salads so we don't really keep a lot of crackers on hand. Also, I must note that overnights the dry room and cooler are locked. The managers pull out what they think we will need for the night (based on previous sales-not some random guess). 

I apologize and tell her that unfortunately that is all the crackers we have (writing this makes it sound like She got the *last* packs but it was understood that I ment the batch of crackers we had in the front). She then asks if I can go to the back to get more. I tell her that the back room is locked overnight and apologize again. She then asks me if I could check the ""other side"".

That's when I lost it. I raised my voice. WE. DO. NOT. HAVE. ANY. MORE. CRACKERS! I go grab the bin that is about 1/5th full and show her. 

I did apologize for my outburst and of course no tip (I deserved that), but look, lady, I wouldn't have told you we didn't have any more crackers if we had more crackers! Like, wtf! If I could go get her more I would have brought her more instead of telling her we were out.

TLDR at bottom. I'm kinda pissed so long.

I love where I work. I make a lot of money and get along with my crew and the management. It's a corporate restaurant and we were recently featured for being a turn-around story... went from worst reviewed location in area to one of the best and it's 100% because of the management that was hired right when I was. In general they are awesome.

But I'm seriously thinking of quitting because it feels like every time I walk into work, someone isn't going to show because they were scheduled on their day off. And I want to go back to school and I don't know if I want to deal with the headache of being scheduled when I can't work which happens to every server that is in college!

Just to give you context... last Saturday both the closing servers and the first cut server were scheduled on their day off. Everyone knew. We had 6 servers scheduled in the dining room, so that was half our crew. One of the closers found coverage, one manager approved the coverage, and then another manager MODIFIED HER BACK TO CLOSING and set the other poor server as EXPO! She was at some wedding out of state and she has requested it off through HotSchedules 2 months ago, and it was approved! To top it off our hostess was also scheduled on her day off... but all the servers there know how to deal because again, THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME! 

I was asked to close, there was no expo because obviously they had to switch the expo to serving too, and I was PISSED. I wake up at 6am Sundays to take care of grandparents, and this was the third day in a row I walked into work and my section was switched because THEY fucked up. We're busy and expo-ing all our own food was just annoying to deal with, but I've done it before, so whatever.

They gave me free food and told me they appreciated me helping them out three times in a row, like saving $5 makes up for that (I get half off the entire menu, and we have ridiculous deals that I can also get half off of AFTER the promo price which is sweet.)

I come in today, and thank God it was dead because two servers were again, scheduled on their day off... Was actually great because they overscheduled... I just don't get it! I've seen their scheduling app, it clearly marks servers availability!!!

TLDR: Managers can't make a schedule without fucking it up and I'm considering getting another job, even though I make plenty of money and generally like everyone here. Should I? I'm going back to college in the Spring.

TLDR at bottom. I&amp;#39;m kinda pissed so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love where I work. I make a lot of money and get along with my crew and the management. It&amp;#39;s a corporate restaurant and we were recently featured for being a turn-around story... went from worst reviewed location in area to one of the best and it&amp;#39;s 100% because of the management that was hired right when I was. In general they are awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m seriously thinking of quitting because it feels like every time I walk into work, someone isn&amp;#39;t going to show because they were scheduled on their day off. And I want to go back to school and I don&amp;#39;t know if I want to deal with the headache of being scheduled when I can&amp;#39;t work which happens to every server that is in college!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to give you context... last Saturday both the closing servers and the first cut server were scheduled on their day off. Everyone knew. We had 6 servers scheduled in the dining room, so that was half our crew. One of the closers found coverage, one manager approved the coverage, and then another manager MODIFIED HER BACK TO CLOSING and set the other poor server as EXPO! She was at some wedding out of state and she has requested it off through HotSchedules 2 months ago, and it was approved! To top it off our hostess was also scheduled on her day off... but all the servers there know how to deal because again, THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked to close, there was no expo because obviously they had to switch the expo to serving too, and I was PISSED. I wake up at 6am Sundays to take care of grandparents, and this was the third day in a row I walked into work and my section was switched because THEY fucked up. We&amp;#39;re busy and expo-ing all our own food was just annoying to deal with, but I&amp;#39;ve done it before, so whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They gave me free food and told me they appreciated me helping them out three times in a row, like saving $5 makes up for that (I get half off the entire menu, and we have ridiculous deals that I can also get half off of AFTER the promo price which is sweet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come in today, and thank God it was dead because two servers were again, scheduled on their day off... Was actually great because they overscheduled... I just don&amp;#39;t get it! I&amp;#39;ve seen their scheduling app, it clearly marks servers availability!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Managers can&amp;#39;t make a schedule without fucking it up and I&amp;#39;m considering getting another job, even though I make plenty of money and generally like everyone here. Should I? I&amp;#39;m going back to college in the Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

Years ago I worked in a great restaurant with a really great group of people. One night I went in for a serving shift where my co-worker Ben was behind the bar. We were chatting a bit before the rush, both mentioned how we wish we were in each other’s sections (aka he didn’t feel like bartending and I did) and we quickly switched before I was sat.

Now I don’t know about you ladies, but when I was on the floor my apron showed resemblance to a purse owned by a mother of 6 children. That thing carried my car keys, granola bars, sunglasses, my chapstick, a headband, maybe even a stack of old receipts for good measure. 

Cue Ben approaching his first table in my old section. He’s throwing out his charm, the table knows their whole order upon first approach, everything is going well... until... I watch Ben reach into the depths of my apron to grab a pen and instead pull out a massive. neon. pink. tampon. And I’m not talking he gently pulled it out and hid it quietly.

Girls #1 &amp; 2 order non alcoholic beverages and then I come to Girl #3 (G3) who's been eyeing the cocktail menu open this entire time.
Me: So miss, what can I get for you today? Looking for a cocktail?
G3: Yes, I'll have a Very Popular Cocktail, and a glass of water please.
Me: Sure, not a problem. May I just see your ID real quick?
Now I need to point out that at the time this particular Fridays location, like most major restaurant chains, had a very strict carding policy. They had been fined a couple times in the past for serving minors for lack of carding, and if done too many times the store ran the risk of getting shut down entirely. We as servers/bartenders were required to card everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, that appeared to be under 40 (excessive, I know) or risk immediate termination. This would offend some ppl obviously of age, but once you explain it's 'card or lose my job' they'd accept it &amp; move on... most of the time. With that said, back to the story.

G3 sighs: ugh, I don't have my ID on me, but I come here all the time. I'm sure the bartender will recognize me.
Now, even if the bartender did know her, I knew that the manager wouldn't approve of them vouching for her. And I wasn't about to risk my job on the off chance this was a 'secret shop' and I was being tested by corporate. They like to do that. So...

Me: I'm very sorry, but unfortunately I cannot serve you without ID. Is there another beverage I can get for you, maybe one of our signature lemonades? They're delicious.
G3  annoyed with me: Seriously?! I'm here all the time. I was just here x days ago &amp; was served. It shouldn't be a big deal.
Me: Again, I'm very sorry for the inconvenience. But my managers say no exceptions. I know it stinks (I'm trying to appear on her side &amp; agree that it's a silly rule, but that it is what it is and try to move on)  I recommend trying the strawberry lemonade, it's our mo... She cuts me off.
G3 like an idiot, to her friend across the table G4: Hey G4 you have your ID on you right? Just get x drink for me and I'll give you the cash for it.
G4 looks at her, then to me, then back to her unsure of how to respond. So I respond.
Me trying to remain polite &amp; helpful: Miss, again I apologize for the inconvenience, but even if she has ID I can't LEGALLY order in a drink for HER, knowing that she's just going to give it to YOU when it gets here.This did not go over well.
G3 highly annoyed now: OMG! Well G4, you were gonna get a drink anyways, right? (Giving G4 that winking look)
G4: Well I...
G3: You said were gonna have one when we came in. Go ahead *wink wink*
G4: Um...
Me to G4: Miss you're welcome to order whatever you'd like. BUT it has to be for YOU.
G4: I'll have the strawberry lem...
G3 to me being loud now in an almost empty restaurant: Are you serious!? I can't believe this shit. I drink here all the time, I've never had this problem before. I need a manager. This is crazy! 

OK, fine then. I really don't have the patients for her attitude anymore. So I go to my managers (the GM &amp; the manager that hired me are on) and per policy, when you need managerial assistance, I explain the whole situation to them both before one of them goes over to the table. She's just upset because I won't serve her without ID. I'm not worried at all about getting in trouble because all I did was do my job. So my hiring mgr (M) is the one to visit their table. I watch as he stands by their table and listens to her complain about me but I'm too far away to hear what's being said. When he returns to the kitchen, he asks me to retell him my side of the story one more time. I guess to make sure my story hadn't changed. I tell him again, verbatim exactly how it went down. No ID, &amp; that she tried to have her friend order it for her. He nods and says ""OK, I gotcha"" and he heads back to the table. I see them getting up and that he's leading them to another table in someone else's section. G3 looking smug &amp; quite pleased with herself. Normally I might be upset to lose a table, but in this case I was glad to be rid of her &amp; her nasty ass attitude. When he returns again to the kitchen I ask him what happened.
M: Well she had a COMPLETELY different story. According to her, she had been here just last week and had had you as her server, and it had been the most ""GOD AWFUL EXPERIENCE OF HER LIFE"" she claimed that you had been rude, vulgar, and out n' out incompetent-- and she ""would just really appreciate it if they could be waited on by different, nicer server."" 
I was AMAZED! The look of surprise of my face must have said it all because my manager immediately breaks out in laughter. And I join him. It couldn't be any funnier! Remember when I said this was the guy that hired me? Well he hired me exactly three weeks ago. And before you're allowed out on your own you have to complete THREE WEEKS of paid training. You don't take tables at all during this time. THIS WAS MY SECOND DAY ON THE FLOOR. M knew for a fact that she was out right lying about me. There's no way she'd had me before. EVER. And in the almost month that I'd been there M &amp; I had built up a pretty good report and got along really well. So with a little malicious compliance of his own, he accommodated G3 and gave her a new table in a different section of the restaurant (more a favor to me so I wouldn't have to see her anymore) But before he sent over one of my  to their table, he informed them that everyone at the table WAS WITHOUT ID, &amp; NOT TO BE SEVERED ANY ALCOHOL. Period. 
I grinned about as wide as the Cheshire cat. It was wonderfully petty. 
I found out from my coworker after the girls left that G3 never did get that drink.

I was working as a server at a popular TGI Fridays in Philly. Sometimes referred to as &amp;quot;Club Fridays&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s how popular it was on weekends. So one day I was working a very slow lunch shift, there are probably 4 tables sat in the whole place.

At the time, I was about 22(?) and working as an event captain in a restaurants underground event space. I was studying for my introductory sommelier exam at the time, and there was a small event that was pouring very, very nice wines; naturally, I was assigned to bartend for this party.
I’m gonna paint a bit of a picture here, because it was all such an obvious harassment charge waiting to happen when you look at it all. 
I live in Texas, albeit a more liberal part of Texas, and it’s still the south. So the party was comprised of old, stout, arrogant, southern, entitled white guys and their wives/ hired escorts. I’m not making assumptions here, and you’ll see why soon.

Event runs its course with the usual amount of creepy smiles and elbow grabs to get my attention, nothing I haven’t dealt with before. The party dwindles down, and it’s well after their time in the event space has ended, but about 3 couples remain. One of those three couples was a man sitting on a couch with a woman in a tight blue cocktail dress, and 6 inch heels entirely covered with crystals, asleep in his lap. I’m bussing the room and they’re all drunk and chatting as I’m doing so. Finally, I come back to grab another round of glassware and after I’ve filled my hands, the host of the party yells after me. 

He tells me over and over how great everything was and what a great job I did, and asked my name. I tell him. The room erupts in laughter, directed at the man with the woman asleep in his lap. He goes “That’s my wife’s name.”
Ok, so we found the escort. 
They all laugh and babble for a minute before returning to me to ask a favor:
They felt as though being underground drinking $100+ bottles of wine all night wasn’t manly, unlike, say, drinking whiskey and smoking cigars(????). So they ask if it would be ok if they could tell their friends that they stayed drinking wine “because the bartender showed us her tits.” They promised they wouldn’t include my name or face.

We wore black on black, and I have a chest that’s a bit hard to hide. So I’m used to creepy old dudes staring. So I composed myself and told them that whatever story they post online about the night is their own and yes, please leave my identity out of it. (Yeah, I know this is where i should have shut it down). They all laugh and clamor again until one of the men yells out “okay okay okay, so are we gonna see your titties or not?”
Without a word I turned directly around and put the glasses down outside the room and went directly to my manager and told him what happened.
Naturally, his first response was “did it really happen like that?” Because of course there was a 99% chance that I was making it up to be dramatic for absolutely no reason. He ended up kicking them out and banning them from coming back, and even made them empty their wine locker they had kept there for years.

The next morning, I worked lunch. The host came in to collect his wine from his locker. He recognized me. He goes, “you’re the young lady that served us last night, aren’t you?” I said yes, I was, without a smile. And he proceeded to blame everything on every other person in the room and said “I hope my friends behavior doesn’t effect my standing with this company.” 
I smiled and walked away without saying anything. Because he was just as culpable for what happened as his friends because he was right there, laughing along with wine stained teeth.

So far, everything is going smoothly, customers are understanding... when this group of 4 comes in, just a family who says they are fine with waiting. 

I had one table open in my section and the host had to put them on a very brief wait so the kitchen could catch up. They were sat probably like 10-15 mins later. They acted nice and happy the whole time. I apologized for the wait, yadda yadda.

I respond by telling her I have nothing to do with the wait, thanked her for wasting my time and told her to have a great night.

I understand being upset about waiting when there is a table open, but keep in mind, your server has ZERO to do with projected wait times, and we are just out here doing our best to make sure you have a pleasant meal.

Fortunately his wife was nice, and explains that hers still his juice in it since it's not cooked to a crisp, and that's why hers appears bigger. He then asks for ketchup.

Well-done, butterflied, with ketchup. Even as someone who doesn't eat meat, I'm cringing on the inside.

I haven't written a post in a while. Sorry if there are grammar mistakes, formatting issues, language, etc. TL;DR at the bottom.

I got hired at a mall on Aug. 10, and started working since Aug. 11. I'm very grateful for this, as I had quit my last job, which was retail, my recently previous second job, on June 29, 2019. I currently work at a small gelato stand in the mall. I get to play music from a tiny speaker, trying samples, but also following health code safety and throwing out the sample spoons after use, changing my gloves constantly, cleaning the station, etc. The cups range at different prices (Sm- $6, M- $8, L- $10, and for the inflatable unicorn- $13). It gets very crazy during rush hours, weekends and holidays. But I'm fine with that, as I work independently by myself most of the time, and the owner of the stand is pretty cool, much better than the last managers I had from THAT diner. The diner was my very first job. So fucking GLAD they had karma bite them in the ass.

Anyways, sorry for rambling on, now onto the main part.

I worked Labor Day from 11- 9:30. It was very busy, and had been making good sales all day. Most people are quite friendly, except for the entitled woman (EW), who was with her elderly mother (EM) (who wasn't rude to me at all). The woman seemed to be around my age, between 20- 23. They come up, and ask the usual questions. Here's the conversation I had with that rude bitch:

EW: ""Hey. What is this? Is this ice cream?""

Me: ""This is gelato. It's very different than ice cream. Would you like to try a sample?"" (Smiling gently at both women)

EW: (Turns to EM) ""Hey mom. What do you want?""

(Her elderly mother, who wasn't rude to me at all, could barely speak English, and took 2-3 minutes to choose a sample. Not a problem, I have patience, and I'm not in a hurry at all. EW turns to talk with her mom, and starts rushing her.)

EW: ""Mom, hurry up. You're taking too long. Pick a flavor already! (Looks at green tea gelato) You want that? Okay. (turns to me) Hey, give her the green tea sample.""

Me: ""Here you go!"" (with a smile on my face, and passing the sample on a tiny spoon. I was in a pretty good mood)

(EW snatches the spoon from me, and hands it to her mother. EW's mother seemed to enjoy the green tea gelato flavor, and nodded with approval. EW looks at the display cup sizes with their prices, has a disgusted look on her face, then starts asking again.)

EW: ""Can you mix 2 flavors in the small? And why is it so expensive?""

Me: ""I'm sorry ma'am, I can't do that. Only for the medium or large cups. And gelato has better quality than ice cream."" (I wish I could've explain to her that, due to the gelato texture, trying to mix 2 of them will not make them stand too long in a small cup, and will stain the gelato scoop spoons, making it a hassle for me to clean them)

EW: ""Are you fucking kidding me?! Why can't you do that? That's not fair! Why are they so fucking expensive?!?? Make the prices lower!"" (Tapping the display cups with prices, then turns to her mother to speak with her. Her back is facing me at this point)

Me: (Talking to her politely, but blunty) Well, that's how it is in the mall.... (referring to the prices in every store at the mall. Sometimes my voice makes it SOUND like I have an attitude)

EW: (With a nasty attitude and snaps back) ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" (While her back was facing me, and drags her mother out the mall, all the while hundreds of strangers are passing by the whole time, minding their own business)

I was at shock at the moment, then immediately got pissed off. Her mother allowed for this to happen, and let her piece of shit daughter, a grown adult, do this in public, as there's no doubt she does this anywhere else. But I soon got back in a good mood again a few minutes later because of the good benefits I have (sampling, tips, hourly pay, any song I play, etc.).

So, yeah, she's DEFINENTLY gonna go places in life, acting like a damn 5 year old child with a tantrum for not getting what she wants. I hope she falls down the stairs, or hit by a truck. I hope I NEVER meet that bitch again.

And trust me, do not get on my bad side. This happens seldomly, as I now handled my emotions better by bottling them in, and thinking about positive things. Thank you for reading this.

Also typing on mobile sorry about format.

I work at a chain restaurant that serves burgers and brews, nothing fancy but also not a fast food joint, families welcome.

Queue party of four, two women in their late 20s/early 30s and two children. 
Cast: woman 1 = w1, presumably mother of the two children, 
woman 2 = w2, red headed bathroom inspector

It starts of as usual during this weekend, the fair is ending in town, it’s the holiday weekend, were staffed but apparently not enough as we get deeper into showtime. I grab a set of silverware for Happy Family, do my usual introduction and right off the bat w1 cuts me off saying they aren’t ready, but the kids will order food and I continue getting drinks for the whole party. I return with ordered drinks, a free refill specialty beverage that w1 and w2 order and two apple juices for the kiddos. They order an appetizer and still need a minute. I do another round of visits to my other tables (no longer than 5 minutes) and return to a more irate w1. I take their order, 3 minutes later kids food comes out. Everything is going smoothly, 2 minutes after that their appetizer comes out. I offer them drink refills because both w1 and w2 finish their drinks but apparently don’t like them, they order a different set of drinks and I nicely have a manager comp the drinks off and instead re-ring the new drinks saving them $2 each drink.( shouldn’t have done that)

With our luck, our conveyor belt machine that cooks chicken and beef patties before we grill them to our guests desired temperatures with some pink or no pink for the beef patties decided to quit working right before Happy Family’s w1 and w2’s food is finished, stopped working. No biggie, as they only ordered food that needed to be fried, however it was behind tickets that were in line for the grill so ticket times stretched to 23-25 minutes. I bring out their food hot and ready and give it to them, I assure there is nothing else they need, everything is in order.

I check in about 5 minutes later to see if everything is to their liking. 

Me: “How is everything going and do we need anymore drink refills, fries, sauce?”

W1: “We. Are. Fine.” 

Okay I don’t push it something else must have ticked her off and if someone gives me that attitude I don’t want to make things worse I just say okay bye. W2 leaves to the restroom and then returns 5 minutes later. She is standing at her table, hand on hip, looking very happy. She continues onto a rant about how the bathroom is filthy, trashed overflowing, toilet paper on the ground, no toilet paper in stalls. I let them know I’ll get someone on it and they say they are ready for their check, come back 20 seconds later with Happy Family’s check as I realize the host staff(who usually are in charge of bathroom checks) are overwhelmed with one host working to go orders and the other seating, I’ll do it later.

Happy Family is now all standing at the edge of their table, I hand w1 the check

Me: “Did you want me to come back? Or are you ready to check out now?”

W1: “I’m just done!” *throws hands in the air and attempts to walk towards the front of the restaurant*

Me: *freaking out because we now get write ups for walk-outs, yet in a professional manner* “I need to run your check, you pay here, with me.!”

W1: *rolls her eyes and head together* 

She turns around toward the table next to theirs, pulls her wallet out and processed to pay me $52 on a $51.87 tab. She turns back to the door and in a tone not shouting but also not quiet says “Horrible service!”

I don’t see what I did wrong, food came out hot, it wasn’t longer than 25 minutes because I know I looked at the ticket time, the bathroom was something I was not aware of (took me a minute and a half to sort the bathroom out) and I even didn’t charge them for the two drinks they drank.

Oh well, I know I’m a good server because I’m a regular weekend closer, I have regulars, I win contests between coworkers on sales and surveys, and get to pick when I want to work. Managers were glad I prevented a potential walk out. It didn’t phase me because I found it hilarious that she could say I gave horrible service, I’m thinking they wanted to find an excuse to get free food and they didn’t get one.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happened a few days ago with the holiday weekend.

He works for a large worldwide chain and we live in a busy touristy city.  He works only lunch shifts, which he likes, and has been with them for over a decade.  Recently it seems like they have been REALLY understaffing and consistently.  They used to have a auto grat but have done away with that and at the same time started scheduling only 2 to 3 servers.  During the week they often won't schedule a host for the daytime and expect the servers to seat as well.  This restaurant is big, with over 100 tables.  

Obviously, this has led to a decrease in tips as people are pissed at the slow service.  People also just leave the restaurant after no one comes to seat them.  My bf thinks that the GM or managers must be getting bonuses for low labor costs because why else would they not schedule enough people???

My question: is there anything he can do?  He is worried that if he goes to corporate they will fire him.  Has anyone gone to corporate with complaints before and had it work out for the better?  

I keep telling him to switch restaurants but he likes his cushy schedule.  I'm a take action type of person but I figured you all might have better insights into what can actually be done.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep telling him to switch restaurants but he likes his cushy schedule.  I&amp;#39;m a take action type of person but I figured you all might have better insights into what can actually be done.&lt;/p&gt;

I just thought this was funny.

Short backstory, I work at this restaurant/bar that sells mainly like burgers and steaks, some barbeque. I work on the restaurant side, but we also have servers and serve food on the bar side but don't allow minors on that side.

So Sunday evening there was a family of 7 in the bar that had a couple joiners and one was a little girl who was like 7 or 8. When the girl joined they were told they would have to move over to the restaurant, which they were totally cool with. They get put in my section but I was already a little busy so I didn't get to them right away, which they were also cool with. They were really chill and seemed to have a little buzz going already from being in the bar for a while.

I go over to take their order and grandma wants to start and order for the girl who is balls deep into her coloring page at this point. Grandma has also been slamming back bud light drafts. G=grandma

G: Okay so shes gonna have the grilled cheese.

Me: Alright sure, what side-

G: And the tomato soup.

They've had the menu for half an hour at this point. We don't list any soup on it, and honestly the only thing that has tomatoes is the chef salad.

Me: We don't have tomato soup.

G: What do you mean?

Me: I mean we don't have that.

Grandpa: What kind of soup do you have then?

Me: Sorry but we only have soup in the winter, sir.

Then the lady sitting next to the girl chimes in.

Lady: Look, you have gravy right? White gravy?

Me: Yeah.

Lady: And obviously you have ketchup, right?

Me: .......yeah.

Lady: Just get us a side of gravy and mix ketchup in it. She won't even know.

Me: *awkward pause and laugh* Ha, that's funny.

Lady: No I'm completely serious.

This table already racked up some money on drinks and I guess.. i just agreed because it's kind of my job to do what they want me to do? I don't even know any more. I just took the rest of the order and rang it in, side of gravy included.

So I work at a chain, sit down restaurant, as a host and I still currently work there. This is my first job and at the time of this story I was probably there for about 6 months. This was a Friday night, which are usually busy, but it was a bit slower than usual. I’m standing at the host stand with another host minding my business when a larger man (it’s relevant) with four other large people with him, walk in.

Me: Hi, how are we doin tonight?

C: Table for five. 

Me: Okay sir, you can follow me right this way. (I’m used to people ignoring me greetings)

Now, at my restaurant, we have tables, booths, and half booth/half tables. None of our tables seat more than 4, so parties of more than that either need to sit in a half booth/table or a booth.  And usually when people say table for x, they don’t actually want a table, they’re just indicating how many they have. So I walk this man to a booth meant for 6 people. 

Me: Would this be alright sir?

C: (very irritated) I asked for a TABLE. This isn’t a TABLE. How are we supposed to fit?

Me: Oh, I’m sorry sir, I misunderstood. We actually do not have any tables to accommodate parties of 5, but I can seat you at that half booth/half table right across, or I can offer you chairs to pull up to the booth!

C: no, no, we’re already here, we’ll sit here (mind you this booth was only like 10 feet from the door so he did not walk far)

I wait for his family to get into the booth, and it’s very tight. I ask again if it’s alright and he angrily says yes. I pass out their menus and go back to the host stand. 

Not even five minutes later this mans comes up to the host stand, and doesn’t give me a chance to greet him or ask if he needed something. He got all in my face (he was probably 6’ something and i’m only 5’4) and starts yelling 


C: I asked for a TABLE. Why wouldn’t you give me a TABLE. That booth is way too small and uncomfortable, I just don’t know why you put us there. 

This man is much taller and much larger than me, and is yelling in my face. I started getting defensive and annoyed. 

Me: Well, SIR, I gave you multiple different options and you said no. And when you sat down I asked again if this was alright and you said yes. I don’t know what you want from me. 

At this point my managers sees this happening and comes over. I’m very worked up so I just go walk into the back while my manager deals with it. When I come back out a few minutes later, the customer and his family are sitting at the half booth/half table that I had offered him first.

I can't give them the justice they deserve in just words. They are like grandparents to me. They are genuinely interested in me and my future. They want the best for me, and they are willing to show this by buying me lunch. 

Even if I've had a bad Sunday, even if life is getting me stressed, even if I never have another pleasant experience with another customer ever again, having those two in my life is enough, and knowing that they see me as a grandson let's me know that they care.

When I first started, I was temporarily covering for a girl around my age who just had a baby. All was well, loved my job and coworkers. Then the girl, let's call her Rat, comes back to work. I kept my job because another person with the same position as me had left the job. I worked every day on top of going to school, so I had quite the busy and exhausting schedule. **I should also note that there were (and still are) only 3 of us in this position!!!!**

Right off the bat I noticed how lazy Rat was. She sat in the corner of area where our front register is. She never stocked the front of the house, did not clean or set tables, no pre-bussing, no refills for customers, NOTHING. But she spent long hours ""helping"" our junkie bosses, that quickly put her in the position of being a favorite with the head of staff. 

Last fall I had surgery and was out of work for two weeks, I ended up covering most of her shifts for about a week and a half, on top of my own. I would also take any shifts she needed me to, so she could spend time with her baby, or do whatever. I did not mind. 

I hoped she'd return the favor the few times I had gotten sick to the point that I couldn't breathe or open my eyes. I also have severe anxiety and that would sometimes prevent me from doing my job proficiently. But not once did she take my shifts. Now, I don't expect a coworker to drop whatever she's doing to cover my shifts, but it would have been nice to have someone take that shift for me. Instead, I got my ass down to work, being barely able to move, and worked those shifts. 

Skip forward a bit, I ended up quitting. 

Well a few months ago I decided to go back, in hopes that things would've changed. Rat is one of my managers, and there are no more junkie bosses! I was disappointed to see Rat as a manager, but it hasn't prevented me from working. When I started working with Rat again, I noticed she became noticeably lazier at the job. Absolutely would not leave our front register to help around the restaurant, took multiple smoke breaks in the 4 hours we worked together. I basically ran circles around Rat, and everyone else noticed it too. 

I'm assuming this upset Rat quite a bit, she started writing brutal notes about me. Things ranging from me being a ""whore"", ""cunt"", ""stuck up pretty bitch"", to wanting to slit my throat and burn my body. This was concerning but I never reported it because I still felt the need to give her the benefit of the doubt. 

Last month I broke two of my toes and messed up my foot. I had to go into work tonight, saw that she wasn't on the schedule, so I asked her if she could take my shift. Knowing that she is now a manager, I was hoping she'd be reliable and understand that I was unable to walk, which meant I could not work. To my surprise, she said she had ""family things"", which is bs because she whines about how much she hates her family and avoids them at all costs. I had recently asked her to cover my shift tonight (she has been off the schedule for 4 days, and I know she complains ab needing money) because my puppy is sick and I cannot find someone to watch and care for him. I know that both of these situations are personal problems, but I would think a MANAGER would be a little more reliable. 

Don't get me wrong, I hate to sound entitled in this post. But I work a full-time job, and this is just my ""for fun"" job. I work my ass off, I swap shifts, cover shifts, and do all the work for her so she can be a lazy bum. I just don't understand why someone would take a ""higher-up"" position if they can't do the job. She gets paid more to basically do nothing and I'm sick of it. This is honestly just a long rant about how irritated I am with my manager. Our supervisor is even getting annoyed with working around her, I'm just waiting for her to mention something to her.
